      "text": "A: Hey, folks. How's everybody doing?\nB: Good.\nC: How about yourself?\nA: Great. Great. I'll be. Apologies for not being on video. I'll be on in a couple minutes. I know. Let's see. Jackie, I'll make sure we introduce you in a minute. I think LIOR is planning to join too, but I don't. Greg, anyone else from your side? I see you and Rob and Revali and it looks like. I think there were a couple other folks, but not sure.\nC: I think Brendan's off. Right, Rob?\nD: Brendan is off. He asked that we record the session.\nE: Yeah, let me make sure I have that.\nD: But Dave is. I was just on a meeting with Dave.\nC: Yeah, there he is.\nA: Hey, Dave.\nC: Hey, Dave.\nA: Let me just check in with Lior real quick too, but then we'll get started.\nE: Hey, once we start, I will start the recording and then I will share it with the team.\nB: Sounds good.\nA: All right, give me just. We'll do one more second, then we'll get started. I see Lior's here now too. Amazing. Yeah. All right.\nD: How was it?\nA: I'll be on video in a minute. Let's see. I figured to get started, we'll let Jackie introduce herself from the AWS side and then we might go around the lighting in progress. There we go. Nice. We might go around the Lightbox side too, just to make sure Jackie has some context on the team. And then we'll dive into talking about AML and I'll let Jackie take over.\nB: Sure thing. I'll introduce myself. So I'm Jackie Rusk. I'm a technical business development manager for our program here at aws. We're called the Application Modernization Lab. This is an invite only program. So you will are definitely federal customers and we are focused on customers that have heavy EC2, Windows, SQL Server and Oracle RDS workloads running on AWS Currently or planning to move to aws. We want to help those customers modernize to cloud native and cloud optimized technologies. Plan today is really for me to provide an overview of the program, the things we do well, the things we like to focus on. An overview of how the program functions and some of the requirements around it. But also I really want to hear from you all about sort of where your modernization priorities lie. The things that are really top of mind to Lightbox. So that's who I am. Great.\nC: Nice to meet you.\nB: Great to meet you all.\nC: I guess I'll go next. So I'm Greg Arpino. I'm the director of finops at Lightbox. You know, part of. Part of My job is managing, overseeing and managing the cost of aws. Obviously, AWS is one of our. Our largest, largest operational costs next to salaries. And so it's, you know, it's something we pay careful attention to. So I monitor and, you know, keep an eye on the cost for AWS.\nD: Next. Rob Riley, director of DevOps architecture at Lightbox, are really right now involved in four migrations that we're doing from on Prem to the cloud that are all Windows based.\nB: Very good. Awesome. Then relevant content we'll cover off on today.\nD: Exactly.\nC: Sorry about that.\nA: Dave Kaplan, VP of Infrastructure Engineering. I cover all of the infrastructure, database.\nC: And incident management functions on the team.\nE: Thank you, David. I'll go next. Ranga Kondapalli. I'm the director of Database Ops. And what are projects which are ongoing for migration? I think Vero. Database involved. We are involved.\nB: Great to meet you.\nE: Oh, nice to meet you too. Thanks.\nA: Okay. I did a poor job of setting the stage because I was making my way between places. So we've worked with Jackie internally. We're very familiar with AML as a program and Jackie, I let you know, but we were able to share a little bit about AML with the team and really that's all we've done. I think we're kind of starting from the top here. But what I did share with everyone and what I guess the account team shared with everyone, broadly speaking, is just that we, you know, to me, AML is one of the more compelling programs that we offer up at aws. It's not accessible to everyone. You mentioned it's invite only, but it's, you know, it's more than that. Right. Like the, I think the profile of the customer, the stage in their journey, and then like, to a certain extent, I think like the kind of the mutual commitment that's already ongoing.\nC: Right.\nA: I mean, like, we already have a deep partnership with Lightbox. We meet with the. The team on a really regular basis. So, yeah, that's. But that's all we've really covered other than that. I think starting from close to scratch might be helpful, especially because you're relying on me to have conveyed the right information. And I don't know that that was a smart thing to do.\nB: If you got us about 80% of the way there, I can get this the rest of the way. So appreciate the introduction and looking forward to learning a little bit more about Lightbox and your priorities. Like I said about modernization. Spent a lot of my career doing projects with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Multifamily and so your mission around real estate data is near and dear to my own passions and history here. So looking forward to hearing a little bit more about your priorities. But first we can just do a brief overview of the program itself, how it works, some of the details of it. What we can offer can also then pivot quickly on the back half of this conversation again around Lightbox's priorities where you all have opportunities for modernization. So is there anything else folks want to get out of this meeting before I dig in? Sounds good.\nA: Sorry. Shoot. I got to mention one thing. Mostly because I felt Greg sold himself a little short, but I was just going to say we, you know we work with a small handful of digital native customers, right. And like not it's not always common to have folks on the phone who kind of under like to have the, you know, the financial perspective and the technical perspective on the call. And like I think as far as tailoring to the audience goes like we're, you know, we're fortunate that we have that here. So it's just helpful context that I probably should have shared in advance.\nB: No, appreciate that and again appreciate the context and glad that we could get everyone on the call here. I'm going to go ahead and share my screen so let me know when you all can see. Okay, super. So like I said Application Modernization Lab what's a little bit unique about this program is like Peter said, we are an invite only program. We are really focused at customers that have very large Windows and SQL Server heavy workloads and we are also a cost neutral program which means the customer does come away at a net zero impact as you make your way through this program. And really what we were focused on when we were created about four years ago was again making a better experience for customers running again those EC2 Windows, SQL Server and Oracle RDS workloads. Making sure you all are getting a cloud optimized experience and that post migration cloud journey continues with AWS as a strategic partner to help you all achieve your objectives. In terms of cloud optimization we can focus on a couple of different things or really what we bring here is learning, benefits and incentives, a dedicated solution architect that only works in the types of modernizations that I've mentioned. A hands on Proserve 8 week lab engagement with each with each AML engagement that has started as well as DIY do it yourself modernization, support, resources and again I'll provide an overview of the nuances of what we cover here. But really what you want to I want to cover with you today is like the who, what, when, where, why and how much right of the AML program. So like I said, invite only, only available to about the top 500AML or AWS customers in terms of EC2, Windows and SQL Server. So Lightbox, really looking forward to hearing about your work again. What do we do? What we do with you is help you with your modernization priorities. We can be very flexible in the way that we run our lab engagements and we want to hear again about what your priorities are in terms of where. Typically we run into virtual model, but we can do on sites as part of our technical discovery phase of this engagement. In terms of when we've got, you know, we've got solution architects that are available as soon as you are ready to go and as soon as your teams are interested in kicking off an AML engagement. In terms of the how here again we can operate in a couple different ways. One, if there is a need and a desire for upskilling teaching and understanding in a lab setting, we can really focus on a learning and enablement style of lab. But that being said, if you've got really experienced engineers, really experienced database specialists, we can also operate in more of a consultative let's just get this done, let's leverage this pod, let's leverage these resources to kick off a foundational and impactful piece of our modernization. Or we can operate with you all in a bit more of a hybrid fast and the how much. Glad we've got the finops folks on the line here who care about the numbers. So all in, it's going to be 497 in terms of financial commitments. That being said, like I said, it is a cost neutral program. As customers work through the AML journey, there are service credits that are refunded back to customers as you hit certain milestones through the program. And I'm going to provide an overview of exactly when you can expect those to really those cash flows to come out and the service credits to come back to you all. But that's really what I want to cover off on today in the next 15ish minutes. Okay, so the way that we operate, it sounds like you all one have some workloads that are currently running on aws. I've got some insight there in terms of what's already running on aws and we really focus in on portfolio modernization for things that have land on the cloud. That being said, we also understand that customers have different phases of their cloud journey. We want to understand your migrations for your EC2, Windows SQL Server and Oracle RDS workloads so that we can help you sequence or plan for modernizations for those workloads as they land on aws. And also we understand that a lot of our customers are talking about Gen AI, talking about unlocking data assets. Data is your business. So we also want to understand if you've got priorities right now that are locked up by legacy architectures, this is a good opportunity for us to help you get ahead of those Gen AI priorities and really leverage this modernization lab to invest and kind of get unlock those data assets so that you can prioritize in those types of activities. We can again run in a couple of different formats. One, we can focus in on one specific application where we just get really deep on one application, but also depending on the size of the workloads that are getting migrated into aws, we can also operate in a portfolio management or sort of a portfolio assessment approach where we look comprehensively at all of your EC2 windows and SQL Server workloads and help you prioritize modern modernization projects or many AMLs tied to this program and help you sequence sort of what an overall portfolio strategy roadmap looks like. But what we can also do is just focus in on the application level if you're really just focused in on one or two specific core applications. Wanted to highlight that this is an option, but again, application and portfolio assessment, we can operate in a couple different flavors as well. In terms of what we do, what we consider to be our bread and butter. As you see here, we've got a lot of different modernization pathways that our solution architects want to talk about with you all on the left hand side of your screen modernization pathways number one and number two, those are going to be what we consider our qualifying workloads. So the way that you qualify into an AML engagement is by tagging $1 million of EC2 Windows or SQL Server. And that's going to be your qualifying metric to unlock. Now we're going to help you define pathways to do a. NET modernization to move you to NET Core, to enable you to move from EC2 Windows to Linux. Or if again database is your priority, if you've got EC2 SQL or RDS SQL, SQL Byll, we can dig into that and help you find strategies and pathways to get you into Aurora and other AWS purpose built databases. That's what we consider our qualifying modernization pathways. But as we get into technical discovery for your targeted workloads, it's not where we're going to limit our conversation and our analysis and our Target architecture definition. We want to understand where your priorities lay in microservice technology, containerization of your applications and serverless priorities as well. Also, something here to consider is tied to DevOps, right, your DevOps processes. I understand that you all kind of have grown over the years through several migrations. Often what we see with our customers that have, or sorry, acquisitions, what we see from a lot of our customers that have had a lot of recent or kind of near recent acquisitions as pipeline management and pipeline rationalization can be a priority. So we want to work with you all to better understand what your DevOps modernization priorities are as well as we're considering this top to bottom application modernization priorities. So this is what we mean and this is what our solution architects in the AML program will focus in on with your teams to define a target architecture through the lab process. Any questions so far or thoughts, especially in terms of priorities of your modernization needs?\nC: So if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like you're using the term modernization really to move towards open source, to move away from vendor specific products, in this case Microsoft and Oracle, onto a more open source architecture. I mean, I don't necessarily consider Oracle and Microsoft to not be modern, but I think, you know, I see the point of moving towards more of a, you know, of an open source type of type of architecture. So that my understanding that correctly.\nB: Yeah, I think that. Right. Our pathways of moving to the open source technologies is definitely an outcome of our AML program. That being said, when we talk about modernization, there may be other things that you want to get done within your applications and your databases through this lab that aren't just tied to getting to open source. Right. You know, like if you've got a monolithic structure, we can support you all in coming up with strategies to decompose the monolith so that you've got, you know, more independent services. It's easier to manage. You can rationalize legacy functions within the monolith and deprecate that legacy code. There are modernization strategies beyond just moving to open source. But if these are your priorities, again that's where we want to understand. Is it just moving to open source that you're interested in? Are you interested in that? Or are there other outcomes that Lightbox is looking for in your current EC2 Windows and SQL Server footprint on AWS?\nD: Yeah, so like currently we are working on just getting some migrations done to move them over the aws, but I can think of like one off top of my head would be rems, which, you know, our Plan was to actually do that modernization first and migrate to AWS at the same time. Because that workload roads on Broadcom's VMware. We actually are now just looking to do a migration assistant lift and shift, just get it off the Broadcom hardware, get it into aws. And that engineering team is very ready to do a modernization of that application. Yeah, I think some of it would be. Is more. They've already started taking a look at it. What can they run on the newer versions of. NET so they can run it on Linux. Some of it is like the web front end is much older and it's going to require a lot more resources to sort of get that, you know, modernized.\nB: What, what technology stack is the web front end running on?\nD: I heard Visual Basic and ASP.\nB: Okay.\nD: Web forms.\nB: ASP web forms. Okay. And web forms asp.net okay, sounds good. Definitely common, especially on run end technologies. That's usually what we're hearing on some of our legacy applications for other customers as well. Just made a note of that. But that sounds like something that we've tackled before in an AML engagement as well.\nD: Then the other three are all much, considerably smaller applications, but still are all NET MSSQL.\nB: Okay.\nD: And that's for things that we're currently migrating. And then we have a bunch of workloads that are still legacy workloads using. NET and Ms. SQL that are already running in aws. And we sort of have to go through them and figure out. Because some of them we already have plans on sort of rewriting using, you know, microservices and things like that. Yeah, so that was, you know, would be a good candidate where others are, you know, there may not be a plan for that right now.\nB: Gotcha. In terms of the stuff that's running on Ms. SQL, I do see some of it EC2 that you all have. Do you have BYOL in terms of your BYOL structure?\nC: Okay, some of it, yeah, yeah. Some of it is byol. Some of it is the. We've used the AWS image, so we're paying the license fee. And obviously the rds, it doesn't support byol. So that's all included. One of the things we have looked at though in some of the SQL servers that we're looking to move into, AWS is doing RDS custom so that we can do. Bring your own media.\nE: I've been using some of those already. But.\nD: Then I think some of the other difficulties we've had. Correct me if I'm wrong, Ranga, with moving off some of the Ms. SQLs is the Geospatial functionality.\nE: Yes. Especially when we consider moving it from SQL Server to postgres like this across cross database server migration. We did have significant issues with and we didn't really find a solution. We had quite a few meeting with AWS tech teams and experts. But yeah, that's a problem. Correct?\nB: Yeah, definitely understand Geospatial is a pretty critical set of functionality for you all just based off of your business. So definitely would need to find some solutions that work well. If moving away from SQL is a priority that you all have or are interested in kind of further evaluating for sure. Question on the licensing side is licensing, I think that you all are concerned about is it. Is it, you know, a piece of your, you know, something that you're looking to do away with if possible or is it something that's not a priority and it's really about the functionality that your databases have around that it's something.\nC: Where it makes sense and it doesn't put the business at risk, you know, and where it makes cost sense. It's certainly something that we, you know, we want to be aware of. We have invested a lot in SQL Server licensing over the years. We have a number of licenses that we, that we own and that we're paying, you know, you know, we're paying support on and you know, if it's possible to reuse those, we'd like to understand how we could. But I think in a lot of cases, a lot of those licenses or Windows or Windows Enterprise licenses, which there's no real option to BYOL in AWS on those, the only thing we can really theoretically BYOL at this point would be like our SQL Server.\nE: I'll add a little bit more to that because I've done some recent comparisons there, Greg, in the context of our RCM migration, I did a comparison for byol, especially in the context of RDS custom. The savings are significant, especially for Enterprise Edition.\nC: For Enterprise Edition. Yeah, yeah. For Enterprise Edition.\nE: Yeah. It's almost like one third cost of the going for a RDS instance.\nC: Yeah. And I had that conversation with Rick Chang on the RCM side as well. To the extent that they're looking to.\nE: Use Enterprise Edition Enterprise Edition, I think we have licenses. Only thing is Cross Edition. How much does it carry or can we use the like for example, we're at some version now and future we are going to some other. Those are the things we need to figure out.\nC: Yeah. And one of the things we do want to evaluate and as part of this would be worth evaluating is whether we need Enterprise Edition. You know, in certain cases I understand we do, but talking through with Rick on it, it sounds like they really don't necessarily need it on the RCM.\nE: Side from a feature that's that's still under evaluation, it's an off site, it's an, you know, we can take the conversation off. From a features perspective, yes, you are right. But from a powering perspective from a resource that is still to be verified.\nC: Yeah. My point being that these are things we need to look at.\nA: Okay.\nE: Yeah, awesome.\nB: Good, thanks. Really appreciate the brief conversation around licensing. It's something that a lot of our customers want to understand a little bit more and it's often a priority so it's good context bringing it back to sort of how AML supports Again these are the kinds of conversations the prioritization of features versus cost optimization. These are the things we can also explore through the technical discovery. So but really these are the things that are our solution architects and our delivery teams do really well is modernization of these types of workloads and really considering it's part of architecture that is aligned with Lightbox or customers objectives. So I want to give you all an overview of the way that one AML standard eight week lab works. So what would happen is if we collaboratively work together, you all identify a workload that is a million dollars of EC2 Windows or SQL Server ARR. That is by the way what we would do then is collaboratively start on what is our AML Technical Discovery phase. Now this is the first phase of the AML engagement and it is free of cost. There is no cost associated with committing to and being a part of the AML Technical discovery. All we really ask is that a customer says hey, I like the idea of this program. We're planning on using this lab function and we're ready to start talking to you all and talking to one of your solution architects about designing a cloud native architecture for one of our applications that is business critical importance to us for modernization. The way that our AML technical discoveries work. AML solution architects specialized only in these types of modernizations would run a series of workshops with your team, your engineers, your database experts, anyone from the application side that needs to be a part of the conversation and key decision makers and what they're going to do is run a series of workshops. This can either be done as an on site, you know, three full days we'll call it or remotely with a series of six to eight two hour sessions with your teams over the course of one to two months and we're going to dig in with you, we're going to understand your current pain points of that application, we're going to understand what your target priorities look like and your modernization outcomes look like. We're going to do code reviews and database schema reviews and collaboratively kind of document that legacy Microsoft or legacy SQL architecture and work with you all to define a cloud native cloud optimized architecture that really kind of gets you all moving into the modernization direction that you're looking to achieve. Now the AML Engagement Specification, that's the document that comes out of the AML Technical Discovery. It's going to document your current state, the collaboratively aligned upon market state architecture as well as a series of outcomes that you all are looking to achieve in the hands on proserve delivered lab. That engagement specifications reviewed by your teams aligned on approved and only at that point at the conclusion of the AML Technical Discovery would you receive a statement of work for that Pro Serve delivery podcast. Hands on delivery Lab to onboard. Now one other cool benefit of the AML is that you do get 15 seats of architecting with AWS. That's a three day AWS classroom based training delivered digitally, but classroom based training to support your engineers to work towards a AWS certified Solution Architect certification. So again that would be a cost neutral benefit. So wanted to highlight that nice little deal sweetener as well. Now coming out of the AML Technical Discovery again so far free of charge, only at the end of it are you getting a statement of work. That's when we move into the AML Phase 1 modernization lab. This is an eight week lab that is delivered by the AWS Proserve team Professional services and what you're going to get here is 190 person days or approximately four to five Proserve consultants that onboard into your environment for eight weeks. They are going to be dedicated to your teams. They'll onboard into your environment, work alongside your teams, work within your tooling to start to make progress on the cloud native architecture that was defined in Technical Discovery and work on that lab scope that was defined in Technical Discovery. They're going to bring their expertise in these types of modernizations as well as modernization at scale tooling that is either developed by AWS or proprietary to professional services as well as kind of bringing that best practices and sort of best knowledge or expert knowledge to support your teams in kicking off this modernization. So it's going to be eight weeks, four to five proserve Consultants fully engaged, operating alongside your teams and within your tooling coming out of that phase. One modernization lab. That's when customers get their first service credit payment. So it's going to be 50% of the cost of the pro served. Billings that are incurred during this hands on delivery lab are immediately coming back to our customers at the conclusion of the hands on lab as well as the cost of the training comes back right at the conclusion of the hands on lab. Now those eight weeks are meant to set in motion an accelerated modernization pathway for your team. Hands on support so you've got tangible progress, something that is like an MVP for your teams of that modernized architecture so that you're happy, so that you have in hand one tangible progress but also an AML roadmap that that outlines the additional steps to take and the path forward for your teams to complete the modernization that was defined in the technical discovery in our third phase, which is the DIY or do it yourself modernization phase. This DIY phase is going to be when the customer teams take on the modernization project that was started in the hands on lab and work on it through completion until it's pushed into production. Now that being said, our team continues to stay in contact and provide post lab support and guidance. Our solution architects would be meeting with your teams bimonthly to provide architectural and advisory support if there is additional research needed on your solution. If you're encountering an issue with the architecture and something needs to be reworked, that architect is going to be available to you all to help troubleshoot those issues and find pathways forward. Additionally, we'll have monthly health checks with the entire project team run by myself as a BDM where we're going to be keeping tabs on risks, issues, blockers that are coming up on your side that AWS can find pathways forward to. Now the supplement service credit that comes back to customers happens when you hit the modernization complete for your workload. And we measure that through tagging of that legacy workload. When we see the legacy resources deprecated by 75%, that's when we consider that workload to be modernization complete. We recognize that when you're looking at an application or a workload, not every single resource or instance is going to be deprecated. There may be things that for whatever reason just aren't worth the ROI to invest in modernization or have to stay put depending on customer commitments. So that 75% EC2 Windows or SQL Server reduction for the targeted workload is that second trigger point so that you recoup the remainder of anything that's paid out and you get that back through service credits. So overall this program typically takes customers between 6 to 15 months depending on the complexity of the architecture, the resources committed and the modernization pathway that's defined in technical discovery. So what's unique here about this program is again this cost neutrality as well as that hands on proserve lab support and the long running support that customers get through the phase two DIY progress. I'm going to pause right here to see what questions folks might have about the way that AML operates.\nD: No questions. I just think I'm wondering if we have any single workload that would cross that million dollar threshold. Is RIMS there? Greg, I think you on zoom on that. I wasn't sure if it was.\nC: Yes, I just pinged you back on it. But it's, it's not, it's not quite there. Between the VMC and the native, other native AWS charges, it's close.\nD: Is that it's on demand cost or is that after edp?\nC: No, that would be after EDP and after any reservations and savings plans, things like that.\nD: Do you guys take that into consideration? Do you take the percentage it would cost in EDP or do you take that all out when you're looking at that million dollar figure?\nB: So we look at usage, we look at the usage that is billed for the previous, you know, three months. So if you all are close, you know, if you all are close we can, we can connect on it and kind of figure out what we've done in the past is if it's 800k or above, we can do like a prorated lab where there's maybe slightly fewer hours associated with it. Another thing to consider is if there are two workloads that are of similar patterns or where you can take the learnings of an AML lab and apply it to both problem sets. That's another way that some customers we.\nD: Can definitely get there. That's not a problem.\nC: Yeah, so. So rims, the trick with RIMS would be that the latest, the latest cost of the VMC wasn't built by AWS because they can no longer carry that lead to Broadcom. So that won't show up, you know, is.\nD: But, but with that shift at first. So it will be running in AWS soon.\nC: Yes, correct. And I think once it's in AWS it's not going to be $1 million workload. SSLV and data platform are probably are.\nD: Yeah.\nB: Question for you all on the rims, is it RIMS application? Yeah, when are you all expecting that to land on aws?\nD: So it has to be off of the VMC by May of next year. So we literally just met last week, made the decision to stop the modernization effort because we're just running out of time.\nB: Yeah.\nD: To do the lift and shift. So we have a planning meeting on that literally this week. The next step will probably be we will start spinning up non production workloads in that account and then we'll start testing the failover of the lower environments with planning. We're doing that for the production environment.\nC: And Jack, it is running in aws, but it's running on VMC in aws. And we're also using a lot of the native aws. You know, there's like FSX and some other stuff, native S3, native AWS components to it. But the bulk of the cost is vmc running in AWS. Our contract will expire in May of 2025. So. So there is, you know, a sense of urgency to get off ahead of that, you know, because we can't go. You can't go on demand anymore.\nB: Yeah, yeah, definitely. So definitely not. Again, a unique situation. Lots of our customers are facing a similar challenge and are kind of making similar decisions here of doing that lift and shift, getting, getting out and kind of. So I think that one, it's not going to be an issue. Right. If it's not showing up. We can work with you all on quantifying that workload even if we're not seeing it currently running, you know, on or build via aws. So that's something that we could probably start a technical discovery on even if we're not seeing it build through AWS just yet. We would just need to work with you all on some sizing of the workload and doing some tagging. We might have to wait to like start the hands on lab component until it obviously until it's moved and lift and shifted over and we're seeing it, you know.\nD: And I think a combination Greg of rims, PCR Report Writer and RCM all certainly would push that over a million dollars if they're all very similar. Net SQL Server workloads.\nB: Yep.\nC: Yeah. Small in and of themselves, but together. I think you're right Rod, that they'll probably push that million dollar envelope.\nE: We also have the SQL Server modernization and if we can, you know, from all the easy to instances, about three of those. It's not a migration per se, but definitely upgrading and all that kind of thing is involved.\nB: Sorry, could you say that again? Or kind of.\nE: We have a. We have a few SQL Server systems which are on EC2 instances but dated editions, basically older editions. We want to upgrade and migrate to.\nD: RDs.\nE: Some of them potentially. So those are the things we are evaluating right now there are about three database servers in the CID world. They are a part of modernization because they are moving away from at least from a SQL Server database editions perspective, we'll be modernizing by upgrading them. Also moving to like an RDS infrastructure or like RDS custom infrastructure. So those are the considerations right now.\nC: And those are all standard edition, right Ranga?\nE: Yeah, they're all standard edition. There's no enterprise involved. We want to make it more, you know, right now it's all our management. So we want to get it to a place where we depend on AWS capabilities to support us on the management.\nB: Okay, sounds good, made a note of that as well as sort of other potential area for exploration and consideration here.\nD: So and then other application Greg had mentioned SSL is Spatial Stream is what we call it.\nB: Spatial Stream.\nD: Spatial Stream, yeah Spatial Stream got the.\nB: The acronym but didn't always good to refer back to it to things that.\nC: We'Ll send you the decoder ring.\nB: Everyone's got one. So okay, super. This is really helpful and again good conversations around the way that this would function. So it definitely sounds like you all are doing modernizations that are similar and things that we have seen before in aml. So again this is invite only. This offer, you know stands for you all based off of where you are in your modernization. Again, if you're interested in having a further conversation or digging into the RIMS application as well as the PCR and report writer. Really what we would do from there is do another sort of deeper dive on specifically those applications, quantifying the size of them and just kind of gathering some basic information pre technical discovery. And really if you all say jump, I say okay, I've got a solution architect. We can get them ready to go as soon as you all are ready to go. Kind of once we do that pre qualification just make sure we've got some details around the targeted workload. So that's really the way that this operates and that's the way that we can activate an aml. An application modernization lab engagement. Some other things to call out here as well is that we do have some resources and partnerships with the Gen AI Innovation center with aws. So if Gen AI is a priority for you all, we can always have conversations of if you've got use cases that you want to bring into the lab setting, sometimes we can do some really creative partnerships with them. Additionally, in terms of proserve staff augmentation, again, if you're not looking for all of the architectural support or the handholding of of teaching best practices and you really just want this to be, get in here, let's get some stuff done. Sometimes we've had success there, depending on the nature of the modernization you're all interested in exploring. So now wanted to give you all an overview of the financial outlay and the way that this operates because I think it's really important for everyone to understand how the cost neutrality functions and works. So there's really three core components to that 497k dollar amount. The first one's gonna be the architecting on aws course, that 15 to 30 seats. That's gonna be that three day teaching course for any of your engineers that are looking to work towards AWS certification. The second bid and the largest amount is gonna be that phase one Proserve Professional Services statement of work. That's approximately $437,000. That is something that is billed as you're working through the AML engagement and as you're actually getting that work done in lab. And the second or the third and final piece of it is what we call our AWS Countdown premium support mechanism. These are support engineers that as you move towards a heavy period of deployment in your modernization, an engineer would be allocated to you all for approximately 10 to 15 hours a week. They're specialists in the technologies that are a part of your target architecture and they're just there to embed with your teams to troubleshoot issues that you might be seeing respond in an expedited manner if there's anything that goes bump in the night during your deployment period and they've got specialized sort of access in terms of issue resolution and tools in their toolbox on the AWS side to help you all kind of troubleshoot any issues you're seeing in a deployment heavy period. Now the way that this works, I'm going to do a little bit of an outline of timing of an example of how cash would be moving in and out for you all. So the way this typically works, I'll give you a highlight of AWS invoice and billing when you can expect to pay it and then when you can expect the service credits to come back. First invoice comes through. It's a training, it's a training and certification invoice. It's that 15k for training. If you do that during the technical discovery or pre lab period, you would get that invoice and then we really adhere to any of your payment terms that are already aligned in terms of working with AWS. So for example, if we call it AP net terms 30, what you can expect is get your invoice kind of right at the start of the lab. You know, a month in you're going to get two things. One, you pay that invoice for the training that invoice a and then you would receive the invoice for the first half of your pro serve engagement approximately 219k. Move forward, conclude the lab, pay the first invoice for the pro serve pans on delivery, you'll receive the invoice for the second half of the proserve engagement. And now this is when that first service credit comes through for the customer where you get one, the training invoice is reimbursed back to you as well as the first half of the pro serve delivery. That's all coming back to you via service credits. They're applied. I manage the service credit process for my customers. So really all it is is a yep, you finished your lab paid that first invoice and I'm gonna issue the service credit. And you'll see it really in your billing console within one to two days of me requesting that service credit. So that's really the function of how the service credits work. Now Moving into the DIY phase, this post lab hands on lab phase one thing, you'll pay that second invoice, that's that second 219K for the Proserve delivery. And this is when you would start. You know, whenever you initiate that countdown premium support, it's going to be 7,500amonth and you'll receive service credits back to reimburse you for the hands on or sorry countdown premium Support Engineer every three months, 22,500 every three months to reimburse you back for that countdown engineer support. And you're like wait a second, I'm still out 219k. Where's that second service credit? That's a big number again. That's when you hit that modernization complete number where you would see the 219K come back to you that second service credit. As soon as we see the 75% deprecation of your legacy resources moved off of EC2 Windows or SQL Server, that's when you get that second service credit. And that's where it makes the fake cost neutral program. Now this is we like to walk people through this upfront because obviously it's a little bit complex the way that, that cash moves in and out. So we wanted to make sure everyone's transparent of the mechanisms through which cost neutrality is achieved. I will ask if anyone has any questions here, but I will also share this with you after this call. As well as a payment stream cash flow ledger Excel, which sometimes people like to do a little bit of a review and then and come back with questions as needed later. But do you want to cover this?\nC: Yeah. How, how does this, how does this relate to or how does it kind of dovetail with, with our EDP where we're going to renew our edp. And I, I guess I'm kind of in my head, I'm saying, okay, if it's cost neutral. Yeah, it's, you know, it kind of really shouldn't matter.\nB: Yeah.\nC: You know, I'm thinking the 497,000 in spend goes towards our EDP, but then the $497,000 in credits.\nB: Yeah, typically I would say that the cash flow of the AML program itself is not impactful for an EDP or kind of it's a net zero or the EDP initially. Something to consider is if you're expecting a cost optimization outcome for the modernization itself, it's something that's good to know about as you're considering EDP terms for the future. One, you can kind of view it as, oh, we expect to optimize x percent on this specific line item. But a lot of times what we see is customers leverage that either to reinvest, either fund additional migrations or for example, a lot of our customers, especially when doing database modernizations, are using it to, for example, invest in gen AI services so that they're still hitting their EDP commit. Or for example, a lot of our customers that are moving off of SQL Server, I've had some customers say, hey, we don't, we don't run this, we don't have a good VR strategy in terms of our database. So we want to actually, the savings that we'll get from our SQL modernization, we want to reinvest for some Dr. Capabilities or observability capabilities that we hadn't had before in our Aurora environment. So I've seen it kind of work out a couple of different ways. But that's more where I see the considerations on EDPs for annual customers is how do you want to manage your post modernized commitment?\nC: Makes sense.\nB: Great question. So, you know, in terms of sort of what's next is really going to be about looking at your your workloads and identifying, you know, an area that you're interested in modernizing. If this is an interesting program to you, I'm going to stop sharing. You know this deck right now. I do have what is called our AML Business Case tool and really what it is is it models out your optimization and kind of modernization opportunities for your current EC2 windows and you know, SQL server footprint running on AWS. So the rims probably won't show up in that. But you know it does give you some idea of what the opportunity looks like. Do you all want to kind of take a look at that for the last 10 minutes or are there some questions that you all maybe have about the way that AML works?\nC: I actually just had one question on the training part.\nA: So we have already done that class. We also currently have active skill builder as well. So not really quite sure how that plays in if that would potentially just get credited back because we're already doing it or is that an additional requirement.\nC: Then like how does that work?\nB: So what we've done in the past is sometimes customers that have already completed that class will opt for a different three day training that is maybe more relevant or a higher level for their engineers to complete. So any three day course that is of similar value can be used in place of the architecting with aws. And if there is not one that is useful then typically what we'll do is just do a zero dollar sort of immersion day for preparation in terms of skill building. So you know, I think I can share with you all the similar courses that can be taken in place place of the architecting with AWS class and see if there's one that that kind of sticks out to you all. Or we can have conversations, you know, if that's not a useful use of time for your engineers, let's have a conversation about that too to find a better Got it, got it.\nA: Okay. Appreciate it. One note on the on the EDP or cross service PPAP the so I was just thinking through the pro serve so the pro serve falls outside the edp. Anyways I just wanted to clarify that so like typically doesn't get the EDP discount and does not count against EDP spend. So as we talk about forecasting going like cost savings like definitely need to take those into account from a demand planning perspective. But the we don't have to say okay well you know we don't have to worry about the cost neutrality and whether or not we should factor the pro serve into the commitment for next year and so on like that we can't do that anyways even if we wanted to from a pro serve perspective.\nC: Okay, yeah, I agree. But the pro serve, the credits we're going to be receiving back though won't negatively. Those will be taken out of the equation for the. Right. So the $500,497,000 in spend doesn't count towards, towards our buy down of the edp. I just want to make sure that any credits we then subsequently receive wound penalize us in our edp.\nB: Yeah, that's right. Correct.\nA: Correct. Yeah. I mean I and I should, as we go through the ADP planning process, we'll take a closer look at it too. But yeah, that's. That's correct. And then I was trying to think through for a second whether I could imagine any scenario where it would negatively impact you and I can't. So yeah, we would be good on that front is my understanding.\nB: Yeah.\nC: So we just need to figure out the cost optimization. So if we're going to be end up saving over the course of the three years, you know, $300,000 would have to factor that in.\nA: Yeah. Especially as it, you know, obviously a conversation for a different call but especially as it if we get closer down to low growth, you know, from that kind of 20% number we've talked about. Right. Which is like we're coming quite a bit lower than that. I think we'll have to be really careful because you know we've talked about the difficulty of the negative growth approval. So I think that is kind of the piece we'll have to make sure we talk about going forward.\nD: Yeah.\nB: It'S a, actually a good segue. I will share with you all sort of our business case tool outputs because you know, might give some idea of what optimizations could look like depending again this is purely done as with some high level assumptions and not we would want to have continued conversations with you all to really model this based off your specific use case. But what you see here, and this is again just based off of your current EC2, Windows SQL, RDS, FSX, Windows EC2, SQL Server, all of those workloads currently running in AWS. So RIM's not going to be showing up here but right now what we're seeing is about 1.7 million annually spent on those workloads and really what we're seeing based off of our general modeling and what we've seen with previous modernizations for customers with similar workloads is a potential 72% cost optimization of those workloads. Now, again, that assumes you touch every single box that's associated with your estate. And the modernization pathways kind of follow the modernization pathways we talked about. So your biggest opportunity here is definitely the EC2 to Linux boxes modernization pathway. Would be interested to understand what percentage of that would be tied potentially to your applications that you're interested in modernizing and the application code itself versus anything tied to your databases. But the other opportunities here, obviously SQL RDS is another huge modernization opportunity. It represents about 31% of your modernization footprint, again not including rims or anything that's in migration. And then FSX Windows is another big one, which is probably tied to your BYOL usage as well.\nC: Does the SQL Server and EC2 costs include storage? Does the RDS include database storage and EC2 include EDS?\nB: It does not include EBS, no.\nC: Okay, so that's strictly compute. That's strictly compute, yeah, it's all compute. And I think what you're going to, what we're going to find as we get into this, at least on the SQL Server side, and I think in the case it's also going to be on the easy to that a big portion of that spend is going to be limited to a small group of instances. I mean, we've got one of our most costly resources is a SQL Server for that spatial stream application. We've got a couple of significantly large SQL servers that are associated with that. So it's not kind of like a. There's not really an equal balance going on. We'll have to look at the big hitters here.\nB: Yeah, makes sense. And what we see is if you're looking at just your EC2 Windows usage. So it's really going to be these are your top workloads or account IDs that are associated. So EDR lock data are going to be your two primary ones driving just the EC2 Windows usage. It doesn't reflect your SQL Server or, sorry, your SQL RDS and FSX Windows usage here. But that's what we're seeing based off of your current usage patterns are really kind of driving, at least by nature.\nC: Of how we set things up originally or in that EDR account that's going to be changing. Rob's under, you know, he's running a program right now, going to be moving to a more distributed, you know, best practice type of account architecture. So that EDR in the near future is going to get distributed out. But right now it just happens that probably a good 90% of all of our workloads happen to be in that EDR account.\nB: Yep. Okay, gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So look, I think that what we would want to do probably is kind of understand from you all is where can AML provide the biggest lift? Is it talking about the rims, PCR and report writer? Is it talking Raja, is it talking a little bit about your SQL modernization and if there's opportunities to introduce Aurora or other non SQL based products? Definitely understand that the licensing piece is is a complexity for some customers and there are some licenses that can't go away or ones that are already sort of used. Definitely hear you on the functionality side for the geospatial or you know, usage and geographic usage activity for the SQL functions as well. So you know, I think for us we wanted to introduce this program, let you know this is available to you for things that are running on AWS and if there is an opportunity to support things that are coming over to aws. So what I can do knowing that we're at time right now, is share with you all the materials we reviewed today, including the first call deck. I can also share with you this business case tool as well as the account workload profile worksheet which really just gives the breakdown of the EC2 Windows workload. We refer to that as the AWPW. It's a super sexy name we know. But so what I can do is share with this information with you all. Take a noodle on it, think about it, think where there's, you know, best opportunities to leverage this. But we wanted to make sure you were aware of this invite only program.\nD: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nC: Yeah, thank you. This is great.\nA: Appreciate it.\nB: Yeah, thank you all, really appreciate it. Cheers.\nA: Thanks Jackie. Thanks everybody.",

      "text": "A: This is the weekly sync with Lightbox, and we're having Jackie Rusk from the AWS sidejoin again to talk to the Lightbox team. Greg Arpino, Dave Kaplan, Ron Frohawk, Brandon Neil, and anyone else who joins. And then from the AWS side, it'll be Jackie Rusk and Lior Sedan and Alejandro Torres. We're going to cover application modernization lab, among other things. Knoxville.\nB: Yeah.\nC: Oh, nice. Yeah.\nB: Yeah.\nC: Is your. Your father okay with. From the hurricane family all right?\nB: Yeah, they are. They.\nD: They.\nB: I guess they dodged. Kind of dodged the bullet. They got a lot of rain and everything, but my brother's a PA and he was saying his hospital was inundated because they were taking a lot of the patients from, you know, further west where they were getting the flooding. They were actually helicoptering them in. They were helicoptering them off the roofs of health of hospitals, you know, for the west and. Terrible.\nC: Yeah, it was definitely. My wife and I were driving back, actually, from the beach, ironically, the day after the hurricane. And the. The interstate signs just said, all roads in western North Carolina closed. Do not travel in western North Carolina. I was like, oh, well.\nB: Yeah.\nC: So.\nE: Yeah.\nC: Well, glad to hear that your family's all right.\nB: Yeah. I40. I40 in Asheville is going to be closed for, like, a year.\nC: Yeah, it's gone, so, yeah, it'll be tough for sure. So. But now. Now to the rebuilding.\nB: Yep, exactly.\nA: Hey, folks, let's see. Alejandro. I know. You know, we'll start with asking the Lightbox team what's top of mind for them. But then I thought we could take some time on AML after, and I'd asked Jackie to join to kind of answer any questions the team had and then also, you know, touch on kind of next steps and what that looks like. I've shared, by the way, I've shared an update with Jackie around the initial conversations being about, like, hey, look, we like it. Q1 seems like a better time or like the right time, I guess I would say. And so, you know, she's aware of the background, but we'll touch on what next steps look like anyways. Alejandro, do you want to. I don't want to take away the beginning, though, where we asked the team if anything's top of mind for them.\nE: No, thank you, Peter. Yeah. So basically, we'll start with if there is anything that the team has that we can help you with now, and then we can jump into the email. I mean, the other topics that they have on the agenda. Most of the team already Know, and I can send some information through email, but if there is anything, you know, Rob, David, Brandon, anybody.\nB: I had, I had a question about some credit memos we received. I'm not quite sure I understand them. I don't know if this is really kind of the forum if Peter. I was hoping, Peter, maybe you might know off the top of your head, but they are. If not, I might have to reach out to the concierge team.\nA: Yeah, I'm happy. I'm not sure I will know off the top of my head. I can definitely help you track him down, though. What are we talking about? What types of credit memos were they?\nB: Can I share my screen for just a minute?\nE: Yeah, go ahead.\nB: Thanks. So there were. So first of all, I didn't see several. Not several. I saw two invoices come in, interestingly, for the VMware stuff. Part of that. And you and I could talk kind of talk separately about that. I did find it odd. It looked like they gave us credits for all of July, all of the on demand usage in July for VMC and for part of May.\nA: Interesting.\nB: So we're what.\nA: Sorry, do you mind?\nB: That was exactly my reaction. Interesting.\nA: When did these come through? Because I, I was looking to. I was trying to see if they had issued anything on the BMC side. I didn't see anything.\nB: Interestingly, the, the May. The May one came through. I think. I. Oh, hell yeah. We'll get to those in a minute. But yeah, there's. This is, this is the one that covered. And I did the math and it exactly covers our on demand usage for the month of July, July 1 to July 31. So it to the penny covers our, you know, our VMC on demand usage.\nA: Got it. Okay. Looks like they issued it on the October 1st invoice.\nB: Yeah. And that one just got issued. This one was issued actually in July and it says it's for the May period, May 1st to May 31st. And it's. It's $2,532. This is my bigger spreadsheet. This is really actually what's. What's. What's owed us. So if you see here, this is what we got in July. So it's the full amount. This is what covered part of May. So without boring everybody and you and I could probably set up some extra time, you know, separate time and talk about it, but they basically ended up back dating. Or they finally got it through and backdated our contract to June when it was originally supposed to renew.\nA: Yep.\nB: And. Or, sorry, to May 21 was. Yeah, to May when it was originally supposed to renew. So because of that, now they're saying, okay, we should get. Instead of saying, okay, we'll get partial credit for the on demand usage, in May through June, we should get full credit. Whereas then in June, when the, when the new contract was supposed to kick in, they didn't register it. So we were still getting on demand charges. Essentially, we got on demand charges between May 21 or when. Whenever the contract was supposed to be. Yeah, it was like May 20th or May 21st. Between then and July 8th. When they finally entered the contract in the system, we were getting on demand charges from aws. So the total of those on demand charges is this is $91,786. So so far we've received $17,000 in credits. So there's basically an outstanding amount of credits due to us, about $74,000. So we'll just have to figure out, you know, how we go about getting those. I'm sure, you know, vm, where Broadcom is saying, you know, go to AWS to get it. I imagine AWS goes to broadcast to get it and then gives it to us. I'm not quite sure how exactly it works.\nA: Yeah, but it's. But, you know, given that, I mean, it's interesting though that they issued the credit memo, those two credit memos, because it, you know, we now know that that's the process. So I think it becomes about tracking down the remainder.\nB: Remainder. Okay.\nA: Yeah, this is. I gotta look into this. But that's. It's helpful to know. I didn't. I looked for credit memos, but it's possible they hadn't posted. I looked probably. Yeah. I mean, pretty close to the beginning of the month. So anyways, that's good to know. I'll have access to those and I'll track down the stat, you know, kind of. I'll try to track down the status of any remain remaining credit memos and we'll go from there.\nB: Okay, sounds good. Yeah. And the other, the other ones were these, which I just can't. I can't figure out what they were for. We got one in August for July and then we got two in October for September. Almost in a mat in the same. The, the one in that we got in August was slightly, you know, like $100 more. But these two were exactly the same amount issued on two separate invoice on two separate days, the 6th and the 7th for the September period. And I'll show you what they look like. It's Weird, because all it says in the. In all of the credit memos for those, it just says AWS support.\nA: Yes, this. You know what this could be, Greg, is a. And I'll get a clear answer, but this could be the change in just the billing process for enterprise support where they're issuing the EDP discount differently.\nB: Interesting.\nA: I don't. It may not. I mean, I would have to. I don't even know if that amount aligns with the discount amount. But they might have changed the process of how they issue of how they handle the EDP discount for premium support. And they might be issuing the credit memos because of that. That's the only thing that I can think off the top of my head. I got to get an answer. I'll get an answer for you. We may end up having to go to concierge anyways. But I think around the VMC stuff, I want to at least figure out how they're handling that at a higher level. And then this, I, this looks to me like it could be a change in how they issue the. The discount, but I might be wrong about that.\nB: Yeah, that would definitely make sense. The only thing really that struck me, if that is the case. And it does. It does kind of make sense. The only thing that's odd is that two were issued. Yeah. In October.\nA: Yeah.\nB: Both. I would. I would say, okay, yeah, maybe they started that. And this is supposed to be August because we got July.\nA: Yeah.\nB: Then maybe this is supposed to be August. But it did say the billing period and the original invoice number were for the September invoice.\nA: Yeah.\nB: So it's just. Maybe they messed up and it was supposed to be August, but I've not really ever seen them mess up before. So. Yeah, usually pretty good extra money back. Or maybe they just duplicated. Because it was exactly the same amount. Maybe they, they. They duplicated it and. Not that. That I want to look at gift horse in the mouth, but I don't want any surprises to happen.\nA: No, no, it's. I'm glad you told. That looks fishy to me, too, because even if they were issuing, if one of them was from the prior month, they wouldn't be the exact same amount. So there's something out there.\nB: Exactly.\nD: Yeah.\nB: Something weird there. Okay.\nA: Yeah, we'll look into that.\nB: Yeah, those were. Those are really my questions.\nA: Okay, cool.\nE: Thank you, Greg, for that. So I think we move to the next topic, which is email. I know the team has some questions for Jackie, so you want to go ahead with those questions, please.\nA: You Know, just hey, I can just set to do a better job of setting the stage right. I think the feedback, and I feel free to correct me, I think the feedback from Lightbox team was that the program's compelling. It makes sense. It could be a really good fit from a bandwidth perspective next year is the, you know, Q1 of next year is probably the best timing. I think there was, there were some questions or maybe some places where we could clarify around. I guess the terminology we'd use was kind of infrastructure versus App, you know, modernization and like how much is the program focused on each. So I think those are the two topics. I know there's a push to kind of get, get the program going with customers who have been selected for this so we can talk about that as well. But I guess for the Lightbox team, like am I right? There was some, we needed some clarification around kind of what the focus was, infrastructure versus app modernization or kind of at the application level.\nC: You know, if no questions, I'm happy to provide my perspective and maybe that will jog some memories to or kind of initiate some conversation. But from defining scope within the terminology of the Application Modernization Lab, we consider we really do all of it right. So if you are looking for more of a pure infrastructure type of engagement, really you're just looking to make the minimal changes required to move from EC2 Windows to Linux. We can target our scoping of the technical discovery as well as the hands on delivery to focus on just making the minimum changes required to enable that infrastructure level change. But is true, application modernization is the priority where you want to look at the comprehensive architecture of your application stack or your database interactions with that application stack. Our solution architects look holistically at your modernization so we can look at that app here of your architecture, help you redesign that for a modern architecture while still enabling you to make the changes required to move from EC to Windows to Linux or for example from SQL Server to something like an Aurora. So really the AML is very flexible in the way that we defined that scope and it's based off of your use case specifically the other. So I guess actually I'll pause there because I think I want to make sure that I may be answering Lightbox's question.\nB: I mean I'm going to defer to Brendan, David and Rob on this one. That's more kind of there.\nF: I think there was some confusion sort of as was more, you know, application focused or more infrastructure focused. To me it seemed like it was, you know, as you just indicated could be Focused on either or both.\nC: Yep, yep, you've got it. I think the other note that I wanted to call out for you all as well is that we do have a Q4 special going where that if you complete four weeks of the lab during this calendar year, you're actually made whole from a cost neutrality standpoint via service credits at the end of your lab. So instead of getting 50% at the end of your lab and then waiting until you complete your modernization to get the remaining 50%, we effectively just make you whole at the conclusion of your lab if you get a minimum of four weeks completed this year. Definitely understand that Q4 is often quite a hectic time for our customers as you are all looking to close out your roadmaps for the year. Vacations are always tricky to manage in Q4 as well and often there is forward looking plans for 2024. But did want to let you know that I'm going to extend that offer to you all as well since you are definitely interested and this does apply. If that's the case, you know, we probably look to connect as early as next week to help do some of the pre technical discovery and get you all in the queue for planning and for the technical discovery portion of our engagement. That being said, you know, we are always interested in terms of getting you into the technical discovery pipeline early. So you know, if there is interest even just to get a technical discovery done this year, if that's supportive of your planning for 2024, that is also an option where we would do the analysis this year, help set you up with sort of a targeted scope and proposal for what we would then complete in 2025. So as a follow up to this conversation, I will one provide the clarifying points about how we kind of do that scoping, two, I will share the Q4 special offer and three, I'll just remind everyone that technical discoveries are always available to you. We can do that in one quarter and then plan, you know, timing of a lab at a, at a later date.\nA: If I could just go rogue and like add a tiny bit of content.\nF: That I have to defer to, you know, Dave and Brandon and getting the product teams on board to actually be able to do that, I think that would be. Again, I think it might be tough.\nB: But you know, yeah, it sounds compelling from a financial standpoint but it, I know you know David and Brandon can speak to it, but their team is just slammed right now with several very time sensitive migrations that we're working on. So it would really be, I'LL let them speak. It'd be a matter of them lining up their team's time.\nD: Yeah, I mean, so I think. I think honestly, there's a lot of potential, so to speak, with this.\nF: Right.\nD: And I personally think that there's.\nA: A.\nD: Lot of room to grow with this. The challenge is that I think at the end of the day, we need to have this conversation with the engineering leaders and we need to in some way, not necessarily get them on board, but rather have a conversation with them about what they're planning and how this may or may not fit. Because, you know, with business priorities and other things that everybody quite obviously always has, you know, we need to find some, you know, I'll say direct benefit that we could point it towards, not necessarily trying to squeeze even more into the roadmap where maybe it does or doesn't fit. I don't know. And quite candidly, from an infrastructure standpoint, a lot of the folks on my team, Brandon and Rob included, are already well on the path of infrastructure as code and, you know, as Alejandro and Peter and others know, you know, in terms of consuming different AWS resources in a modern way. So, you know, what we really need is to, you know, think about it more in terms of building new things together. And that is, I think, to my point, more inclusive of, you know, the engineering teams, not just us, you know. So I know that Ron is typically invited to this meeting, but obviously he's not here, so he would be a good one to talk to about this. We could. Peter, I know that you periodically chat with Eric. I don't know if you brought this up with him directly, but he would be a good one to talk to about this as well. And then we can, you know, obviously pull in the other engineering managers, so to speak. But I think that those would be two good people to start with.\nA: Jackie, I mean, that's a. That's an interesting thought. I mean, I was just going to say, in response to what Dave was mentioning, we could. Ron is at least aware of aml, but he hadn't been on the call when we talked about it the first time. We can make him aware. And then obviously Eric is the cto, and it would be a good idea too, I think, to make him aware of the offer. I think just one quick point of context, I guess I would say, is in terms of, in my view, where the promotion is coming from. It's just that this, the program, like Jackie's team, it's just been identified as a strategic priority for the business.\nB: Right.\nA: They've said this, it's a good program for customers. We offer it pretty narrowly. And yeah, it's been. It's. It's been good for customers. So what they've done is they've kind of doubled down on the focus, and we're in a good place because we're. Because Lightbox is eligible for the program to begin with. And Absolutely, you know, that's good.\nC: Yeah. And very happy to join and kind of do the same kind of overview of our program with Eric and with Ron as well. So I'm always happy to join a call to help kind of introduce the program as well. So please let me know if there's any time that I can hop on a call. Very happy to do so.\nD: Yeah, I honestly think that that would be great. You know, Peter, I don't know when your next chat is with Eric, but if you want, maybe add me and maybe Greg and Rob to that conversation. And Jackie, if you're available, we can all jump on in a, I'll say, slightly larger group. And, you know, I don't necessarily want to assume that we're wasting anyone's time by going over things that we've already covered, but I think that it would be good for them to hear from you directly, and then that will help us, you know, collectively think about some of these things.\nA: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I can.\nC: Happy to do it.\nA: Yeah, I can take the lead on getting that set up. Thank you, Jackie. Anything else you wanted to cover? Or else I'll, you know, let Alejandro take over?\nC: No, I think that that's really all that I had. But again, do reach out directly with any questions you all have. I'm always happy, even if it's a, hey, we're thinking about this in our modernization priorities. Is that something you do? Always happy to, you know, chat things through via email as well. But in terms of next steps, Peter, I'll just work with you offline around introducing this with Eric.\nA: Sounds good.\nC: I'm going to hop off, let you all get back to business as usual, but thank you again for the time. Appreciate it.\nA: Thanks, guys.\nE: No, thank you, Tim, for that. And I said the agenda is not that big today, but I want to focus on a very important item. I know there are not many databases, but this Aurora MySQL you have like six databases that are going to be entering into extended support if you don't upgrade by the end of the month. I have sent the list, but if you need, I can resend that list. Make sure when you Enter into. It's not optional. You are automatically enrolled if you don't do the upgrade. And that is a cost per hour or something like that. Even though there are six databases, might be some cost for you. So the recommendation is to upgrade us before the end of the month.\nD: You said there were.\nB: So was that Rob at all?\nF: Ron?\nB: I. I suspect it is. That's what I was about to ask. A six sounded. I was kind of a bit surprised by six. I'll. But. But if that's true, that's. There are. Yeah, I would probably say they're probably mostly Ron's, if not all.\nE: Yeah, I can share the list again. I will include them after the. In the notes. The whole list again, just to provide you with information. If you need anything else, just let me know. Yep.\nB: Actually, I can look right now. Wait, now you keep. Keep going. I'm just going to take a look. I have. I have a way of looking at all the quality databases from one view.\nE: No problem. The other one item that I wanted to talk about, it was the weather architecture review. I know. Rob, you are working with the team to pull the Live Box application to make it ready on the new infrastructure. So let us know when it is available or if you have some information about that.\nF: Yeah, I mean, it's basically EAP right now for that application. I was going to be honest, like if we can start scheduling maybe around the holiday, around Thanksgiving when it slows down a little bit, that might make sense. Okay. Again, we just have, you know, these migrations. We're trying to really get pushed over the, you know, the finish line here. And if, you know, by the end of next week, we are where we want to be, then maybe I can reach out and we can schedule a little sooner.\nE: Okay, perfect. So we will start getting by, let's say the end of November. And if you finish before you let us know and we can always accommodate to your schedule. Wrong.\nA: Okay.\nE: Perfect. Nice. No, thank you for that. Also, about the AWS backup conversation. I know we should have had on Thursday, but there were some inconvenience on the schedule for our SME. But it's rescheduled for Monday. I think Ron will be also available on Monday. So he was. She wanted to be part of this conversation. So we will have more technical discussion on specific items like what AWS backup is and if it might cover all the scenarios that you need for this strategy.\nD: Sounds good.\nE: And I use. I know Chris is not on the call, but as part of the Trust Advisor, I send a recommendation to rotate the keys and because we did the rotation because of the incident. I resolve on his behalf. Just wanted to inform him but he's not on the call. So I will send him a note just in case he sees an email or something he receives from AWS or myself. He doesn't get like what's happening there. So I will inform that. And I saw today that there are some also some RDS databases that are not enabled and those are in the EDR account. So I can send also the list just in case. The team probably might not be that important those databases. That's why you don't have like enabled backups or things like that. But it's always important just to validate to make sure something happens. You have a backup to restore those databases. But I will send that list as well. So I don't know these are the topics really I have. So I don't know. Leori, you have something else from your site or Peter, what about the Libox team? Anything else that we can help or support with?\nA: All right.\nD: After that we can think of at the moment.\nA: Yeah.\nE: Perfect. So the only action item that we have on our site then Peter will be review those gradient memos that Greg was mentioning to see what are the meaning of those and what we are covering. I will try to find information Greg send it to you. But in the meantime, you get anything else or you see some of the information, you just let us know so we can track it down.\nB: Sounds good.\nE: Okay.\nA: All right.\nE: Thank you everybody. Have a great weekend. Hopefully everybody enjoys and has some free time. Rob?\nA: Yes.\nB: Were you about to say something, Rob?\nA: No.\nC: Oh, sorry.\nB: I thought you about that question.\nD: Have a great weekend.\nA: Thanks guys. Have a good weekend. Thank you. It it it here it it. Val, do you want to go out and we went to Thea.\nE: Wow.\nA: They said she sh a mask out. Hi. And she got a sliced loaf of sourdough bread. Yeah, I already froze it and got a lo. I'm going to go. Wow, you have quick. Actually, would you be able to land in a minute?\nB: I got a call.\nA: We're going to leave at 3:45. Perfect. What's the next. What's the status? The next step? Oh God. Imagine the thoughts she could have in that time. That sucks. I hope she's. I'll be ready to go though.",

      "text": "A: This is the weekly sync with the Lightbox team, between my team, the AWS team, and Lightbox. And it's like sunny and blue skies. I was like, oh, okay, it's gonna be warm outside. And it was like 63 and I was freezing.\nB: Oh, 63 and freezing.\nC: Yeah.\nD: It's not terrible.\nC: I'm in New York city. It was 31 degrees here for most of the wishes.\nB: Morning.\nD: Yeah, it was chilly this morning.\nC: Yeah.\nA: Yeah. That's rough.\nE: That's.\nA: That's rough. And Greg, like boots and heavy coat.\nD: It's five o'clock in the South Sandwich Islands. That is.\nB: I'll be taking my meeting from there. Bring my bottle of bourbon with me.\nF: Where are you going?\nB: The South Sandwich islands, where it's 5 o'clock.\nF: I'll be joining there.\nC: Yeah.\nF: Thank you. Thank you guys for joining. I think we have most of the team. We can start a little bit and then we will catch up with the other team members when they join. It's three minutes after the hour, so the first thing. As always, thank you for joining. Good afternoon. And before we start, anything from your side, John, anything, any topic that you have, you have been working on that you might need some help from awsi.\nD: The only thing I really have is I would like to set up time and I'm happy to reopen the support case on the AWS client thing, which is having a ton of issues specifically on Mac. And I know the guy we were working with was sort of a sort of open VPN specialist or AWS VPN specialist. It'd be great if I open that case if we could set up a meeting with someone who is sort of a specialist for the client on the Mac side because there's definitely something wonky going on there.\nF: And this is the client vpn, right?\nD: Yep. Yep.\nF: So if you can open the case and I will try to see if there's somebody can join.\nD: Okay.\nF: So we can try to set up a zoom call.\nD: Yeah, probably the next. Early next week. That'd be fine.\nA: Yeah.\nD: Okay.\nC: Thank you.\nD: Yep.\nA: Yeah, I think I'm good on my side for now. I'm sorry, Greg.\nB: Oh, I was just gonna tell Andre. I know we were tracking. At one point there was. There was an issue where I was trying to get an account moved into the lightbox. Org. It was. It was a. An orphaned account. And. And I kept trying to, you know, I kept inviting it and it would get the invitation, but when you accept it, it would show no invitations. And I finally figured out what was going on. It's that whoever created that account created it even though it was a singular account. They created it in its own singular org.\nA: Oh.\nF: It was the master org for itself.\nB: And it was the master of that org. So I had to remove it from its own org to make it a standalone. And once I did that, the invitation showed up and I was able to accept it. Good.\nF: Would you want to move into the new control tower organization or just on their own?\nB: No, not. Not yet. Because I'm letting Rob kind of handle or maintain the flow of taking the old accounts from the old org into that. Into the new organization structure. So I just put it in the old org for now.\nD: Yeah, we'll have to open the case on that because we tried with your directions and failed last week.\nB: This week.\nF: Oh, it failed in. In the dev environment.\nB: Yeah.\nD: There's something preventing us from moving it and we. I think we had followed all the. All the requirements that were required to move it, but it's still failing.\nF: So yeah, let's try to open a case probably. And I will follow up on that and just let me. Not here.\nD: Yep, we'll do.\nB: Did you ever try the next day, Rob?\nD: Yeah, in fact I just tried.\nB: Oh, okay. Save same error. Yeah, we're getting an error saying that it was violating a constraint.\nA: Yeah.\nB: To remove it from the1org so we could move it into the other org. And we thought it was like payment. So we added a payment. You know, we added a card. We did everything we thought should be able to make it stand as a standalone org, but it still was saying a constraint was violated and it wouldn't tell us what constraint.\nD: Right. But yeah, we'll open a case and we can deal with that next week. I don't want to take up too much time here.\nA: No, yeah.\nG: Thank you.\nF: I will keep monitoring those two cases. The VPN and this organization's one.\nD: Okay.\nF: Okay, let's jump into the agenda then. I know LIOR has been communicating with the team about the RDS postgres database having some issues when they are going to specific ac. Do you have some other information, LIOR or.\nE: No, I think Ron, if you want to connect us with the team or just answer the question.\nG: I'll get you the questions answered and I'll get an email Leo to you.\nE: With.\nG: Tyler and Dave Moss directly. They'll do both.\nC: Perfect.\nF: Thank you.\nC: Run.\nG: Can I send you back times for the Bedrock guys?\nE: Oh great.\nA: Thank you.\nF: Everybody here. Before I forget.\nA: Ah.\nF: Okay, perfect. The next one. I know, Peter, you have been working with Greg on the edp. I don't know if you have any updates. How is the conversation going?\nA: Oh, great. I feel bad for Greg. He's probably tired of spending time with me this week, but I love doing this stuff. Yeah, we have a good time, actually. The only thing is I didn't have a chance to respond to your email from an hour ago or so. You're still okay to sync up after this? Greg just.\nB: Yeah, yeah, okay. I am.\nA: Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. But, Alejandro, things are going well. Like, we're. I guess for broader context, it's kind of a matter of finding the right forecast that Lightbox is comfortable with and then making sure that we can kind of drive the right approvals through internally and strike a balance there. And, you know, especially because we're looking at, you know, aml, for instance, next year and some of these other things that are just hopefully going to drive savings and keep AWS costs down so that they're not growing exponentially with revenue, basically. So anyways, we're. We're working through that to get to the right numbers.\nB: I think we're pretty close.\nA: Yeah, it feels like it. And I. And I think also, you know, we're trying to keep it as absolutely simple as possible. I've told the team internally this, but like a, you know, want to avoid getting SC and all those other teams involved if we can.\nE: Are you negotiating like bad cup. Good cop. How are you?\nA: What's your strategy? 100. 100. Bad cop.\nB: I've got multiple personality disorders, so just depending on the day I get on the call, both of them, you know, he gets good copy and bad cop.\nA: That's funny. I was gonna say he has one speed and it's bad copy, but he's.\nF: It can change. Probably you haven't found that.\nA: Yeah, right.\nF: A specific way.\nB: That's right.\nF: Thank you. There is a topic that we talked about before, just to see how it is going. This is about the cluster migration. Have you been working on this as a poc? Do you have any plans or any. Any help that we can provide from our side?\nA: Yes, on Timmy's priority, Gl us talk.\nD: About it, but I don't know where they're at with it.\nA: Yeah, I. I think it's pretty low. Yeah.\nB: Yeah.\nA: No, no updates on this yet. It is a. I think it's not a trivial thing that we would need to do to migrate a bit.\nD: A lot of data.\nF: Yes, I remember it was like a lot of data that you have there. If you need any assistance from osilos, let us know. We can again bring specialists. If you have questions, anything that we can help to move forward, let us know.\nC: All right.\nF: And I know the team is also working on some migration of on premise GPUs to AWS. See how the project is going. The thing wrong. You're working, your team is working on that, right?\nB: Yeah.\nG: So right now all we've done is we just did some budgeting and forecasting for 2025. There's some work that we did previously where we set up some AMIs. We're doing a refresh of the AMIs that we had previously and we're going to run back through the same workflow with those amis. And then we did look at some of the smaller, I guess the G4 instances, right. Which are just not. They're not the biggest, you know, a 100H100 type GPUs, they're just more of a rendering GPU. And our inference for that process, that's more of what it makes use of. These are ones Rob is well familiar with. These are actually internally, they're Alienware desktops and they repurchased them just because they had some specific GPU cards in them. So we're just looking to move all that stuff out of the Shelton Data center and find a, a reasonable cost basis for a replacement.\nD: 30-70S, 2000-70s.\nB: Yeah, yeah.\nD: Okay.\nG: Sir.\nE: No, is this, is this relatively kind of not a lot of money that we're talking about, or is this.\nG: Unfortunately, the G4s are expensive.\nB: Right.\nG: So, you know, I mean, relative to like us looking at, if we purchase something of a similar size on prem, it's about one and a half times for year one.\nB: Right.\nG: So what we are going to try to understand a little bit better about the usage patterns, how much we actually use them, because they are. We've run a process. Our goal is to process imagery for about 400 counties per quarter. And so we figured that right now that ends up being like 22 out of 30 days is the processing time.\nA: Right.\nG: So they're fairly well, fairly well used boxes. But once we get the amis refreshed, we'll do some more validation with it. It's a process we started last year, pull the budget back for both AWS and for capital spending. So I'm just coming back around to do it again. So that's fine. We'll follow up.\nB: Yeah, that, that processing time may actually end up getting reduced, Ron. Right. You know, so we'll be getting a little bit more horsepower out of the machines in aws.\nG: You know, definitely newer processors, newer cards, new everything along line. That's why I want to go back and re. Benchmark.\nB: Yeah. Along the same lines, if you bought.\nD: New hardware it would probably still be cheaper.\nB: Right?\nD: Like because you can do a lot of things now where you don't have to buy a PC for everyone. You could have multiple carts in a single chassis.\nC: You can, you know.\nB: Yep. You're fading out, Rob.\nD: Anyways.\nG: Yeah, yes, the same point though. Yes we did look at, hey, you could go buy you know, some, something today with the chassis with you know, dual quad GPUs in it. Again we're not trying to get you know, A100H100 type class machines and it would be, you know, I think we forecasted this out, it could be like maybe 35, 40 grand a year AWS. I think we forecasted out the first year costs like 25,000 for the box.\nC: Right.\nG: But then we have to bracket stack, manage, monitor. Nobody wants me to do that.\nE: Juan let me know if there's any appetite to try the, the Amazon chips. Those might be cheaper, the infringement ones.\nG: Yeah, I just don't know. So we have some dependencies on some dependencies for the services that we use on Cuda. So that would be, I don't believe today that that's actually supported. It's a different stack.\nB: So I think that would be a.\nG: Problem and it's not. Some of these are not services that we, we built. We actually have some open source tools that we use on cars. So unless they have support for it, we would not be able to support those.\nD: Okay.\nE: If you do, if you do want me to take a look, I can take the model, the Python code and compile it for those chips. So if you want I can even do that for you. If you feel comfortable sharing the code.\nG: Let us do the review and the, you know where we find on the benchmarks because everybody's point it's going to be faster. So I might be able to get more than my either I'll either go back and get more than 400 per quarter or if I cap it still at 400 per quarter then I may be able to process, you know, in.\nB: Less time which is, you know. Yeah.\nF: Thank you for the day. And Lior, the next one is about Ring Ben and for that we have the men of the hour. Lior here. He has been working a lot of scheduling making sure all the teams are available.\nE: Well, we have the haters backup meeting finally on the books.\nB: Is that going to be virtual meeting or is it just a meet and greet kind of thing.\nG: No, I think in the meeting it actually says it can't be virtual because there's no setup for external folks. If I'm in the room, it says something about that. For the room. It's only on in person.\nA: Yeah.\nE: Guest room in the. In the hotel that we take for meetings.\nB: Okay.\nG: But yeah, hopefully.\nE: Looking forward to it. Hope it's going to be productive. Or Tuesday. David, I don't know if you forward the invitation to everybody.\nG: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I sent it.\nH: So I've got three people from my team coming with Rob included, so I forwarded to them. Ron, I'm pretty sure you have it as well. You're welcome to forward to Mark and Chai if they're interested.\nA: Yeah.\nB: Only be Chai.\nG: Mark's not making the trip.\nD: Oh, okay.\nH: That's too bad.\nB: No.\nD: Yeah, I have it.\nG: I'll make sure before it is checked.\nC: Cool.\nB: Thank you.\nA: Thank you.\nH: And thanks, Lior, for setting that up.\nE: Yeah, should be fun. And then also encourage you and the other people to go book for different sessions. They fill up very quickly.\nD: Oh, have filled up already.\nB: They were filled up three days after.\nG: You said it was out.\nB: Exactly.\nE: I don't know how I should feel. I. I'm presenting and my. My session still has room, so.\nB: Really?\nE: Don't tell me that.\nG: I'm sorry. We need to finish your session, so.\nB: Yeah, we might need to sit in.\nG: The back and heckle you or something.\nF: We're just asking questions.\nB: What's your session about there?\nE: It's presenting with another customer. Not a customer that I love as much as I like you guys. Just kidding. Another customer. They migration from on Prem to aws, so should be interesting.\nD: Nice.\nE: What's the. Oh, Ron, I sent you if you want to meet with the Bedrock team.\nG: I sent you back times a couple minutes ago.\nC: Oh, perfect.\nA: Yes.\nE: You just said so.\nB: Yep.\nG: And I'm getting the stat the stats for the RDS stuff that you asked for.\nA: Awesome.\nE: And Rob, thank you. I saw your response on.\nD: Okay, Zoom.\nE: So I'll set that up for DevOps Guru.\nF: The team is gonna be busy.\nC: Good job.\nF: A lot of good activities happening at rimbed. Okay, so before we move to the next topic, is there anything else from your side? I know you, David, you joined a little bit late. Anything from your side?\nB: No, nothing for me.\nG: I have one. So that kind of is a dual question for, I guess Greg and I think it's for Peter.\nB: Right.\nG: So we have a project that we're doing that we're migrating our document extraction processes and OCR processes from Google to aws. And so I had asked Greg about whether or not we'd want to set up something for map credits for that migration. I know Lior set up some time for us with the Google side to move the EKS GKS to EKS portion. That's well underway, but the next portion is probably going to be the harder part for us is the Google vision to techstrap portion.\nD: Ron, is that going to run in bloat data on the cluster or.\nG: Yes, currently it's running on load data. They've got a dev environment set up. So basically rebuilding the existing. I don't remember what the heck CICD we were using previously, but getting all the git to get actions in place, get all the helm charts in place. And they do have a working, you know, single pod set of that for a test or dev environment.\nD: So they will have to set up separate worker nodes with taints on them so that only that workload runs there. So you can tag it with the map credit.\nC: Yep.\nG: So my understanding would be that part of the question is like, hey, so just create a new node pool and just add that to the definition.\nD: The map credits to the tag. Exactly.\nG: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was mostly just opening that up and then the second part. So Leo, I know is getting closer and closer, but that might be something if there's some path or conversation to have about migration, if there's anybody at Reinvent China I can talk to. We've done our investigation. At least we know what the deltas and differences are, we think. But if there's somebody we could. We could touch. Touch base with on that when we're there, that'd be great as well. So on both questions. So just setting up the map.\nB: Be glad.\nG: Great to figure that portion out and then we'll start working on the OCR side. Probably in the next three to four weeks we'll actually start.\nA: Got it.\nF: Yeah.\nB: And that does remind me too, thanks Ron. That we do have actually a couple other migrations that are either in flight or going to be coming up quickly that we do want to get maps set up for. Okay. Might have brought that up in the past, but I don't know what the next steps are there. If that's something I do through you guys or something I have to do online or what.\nA: No, we should. I think this is something I owe you that just got deprioritized a bit deep. We should set up a call with. We have A new map specialist. It's been a month or so now, so I think, anyways, we should set up a call and review each of them. It always works like this. But let me also double check what the impact renewal is and stuff like that. I want to make sure we get the timing right on it. And because I know they, they do ask some of those questions around, like, are there any maps in flight? And are they, you know, what do we have to take into account?\nB: Yeah, and I did kind of in my numbers, Peter. I did factor in that, that we would be getting some kind of a map discount. That. That's all kind of factored into that.\nA: Got it. Okay.\nB: To the numbers that I came up with.\nA: All right, that's really helpful. I think either way, we definitely got to get the call set up with the map specialist because there are a couple of them and I think you're going to require guidance. So let me. I can send you some times. I think when I asked this last time, it sounded like most of the team on this call should be included in a call with the map specialists. It sounded like. But tell me if I'm wrong about that or.\nB: Sorry, Wrong about what?\nA: Sorry, is it. Let me rephrase. When I set up the map call with this specialist, just to go over to review the different projects we might be trying to move under map, should that be just with you, Greg, or should we also go ahead and include Ron for this specific migration, for instance?\nB: Or, you know, I would include Rob and run. David and Brandon are happy. Yeah, I'm happy to have you guys in there too, but I think, you know, it might just be overkill to have everyone in there. So I would say between Rob, Brandon and David, you know, who know what migrations we've got coming up or in flight. Yeah, I don't. I think only one of you guys needs to be in there and then Ron.\nA: Cool. Yeah, I've already asked them for the time. I just never really followed through on scheduling it, so that's my fault. Well, we'll get it scheduled and we'll be able to address all of those. Sounds good.\nC: That's fine.\nH: Greg, you can include me. And if there's anyone from the team.\nC: That we need to pull in, then.\nH: I can do that. But I can shoulder the meeting, so to speak, so that we don't interrupt too many folks.\nB: Yeah, that makes sense. So then it would be. Yeah, it would be David, Ron and myself.\nF: Perfect, thank you. So the next topic we have Maya. You met Maya before about talking incident Texture and response. And also team from Lightbox we have John who is the incident manager. So please go ahead. Maya, if you have some material or the team from Lightbox if you have specific questions or something that was pending from last conversation.\nC: Thank you. Nice to meet the folks that I've already met with David, Greg and others. I wanted to know what would be helpful for you to start just to refresh your understanding of what incident detection and response is. I'm happy to go through that. Peter and I have also worked together to put a proposal in front of you. And this proposal means that we're happy to see you on this service so that you can evaluate the benefit that it brings to the business. And for the first few months in either option that I'm going to present, we'll also be happy to help given that there's an additional cost. It's minimal, but even with that, I'm happy to help some credits and Peter and I can look at any option that suits you. So what would you like me to start with? Would you want a refresher? Would you want to talk about a proposal? What makes sense?\nG: Yeah, maybe a quick refresher for the.\nH: Folks that didn't hear last time. And then I, at least at some point before we're done today, would like to get an idea of what that minimal cost actually means.\nC: Okay, Absolutely. So just a refresher. I'll be sharing my screen and David or Greg, if you feel like I've made my point, please just let me know so I don't bore you. Can you see my screen?\nB: Yep.\nC: Awesome. Yes, you can minimize your wonderful faces here. So we talked about a challenge that comes from having enterprise support with a reactive support, which means you submit cases, we respond to them within 15 minutes. The challenge comes from the most critical components in the environment. Well, this is essentially a great solution for all other cases for something that doesn't even have minutes before we focus on investigation and remediation in the right area not work. Our response to that is an enhanced support. And that enhanced support comes in the form of AWS proactively reaching out to Lightbox within five minutes of your alarm triggering. From that point on, very much a different custom engagement comes from understanding the context of disruption. We'll talk a little bit about what it means to be supported in this way and what information you will need to share with us so that we can be proactive and we can't be a lot more efficient in your investigations. And I've prepared also pricing and the proposal that I'd like to present to you, if we have any time, which I don't think we will today. We can talk about other support services, but we can start with Incident Detection and Response. I'll call it IDR or Critical Workload Support. So this is the general process that you currently have with enterprise support. And this process applies when you have a support case coming from a critical component. Minutes matter in this scenario, all hands down deck, you still need to detect the issue, triage it, raise a support case to AWS that gets a cloud support Engineer engaged within 15 minutes. But we are only reactive in this scenario. We will work with you to resolve the issue, but we rely on you to provide a lot of that context as well as a lot of the context of the impact within your environment or your customer, so that we can move with urgency. So this may work very well for other components, maybe less critical. If you don't even have minutes. We want to put in place a different process for this because what makes this process even more complicated than you just raising support cases is when AWS is reactive, that means that you tell us where to go investigate and we go and investigate that with one service team after another after another, sequentially, which takes even more time. And neither of these service teams are huddling in some back room sharing information so that this could be more efficient. They each come in to look only at their service in your environment. So a lot of context needs to be shared with them for them to understand what it is that you are experiencing. But then they log off. And in this process, the cloud support engineer that started with you, this investigation may also log off. They're bound by ship. So we've noted these challenges. You are observing something that we are not. At the earliest possible moment, the CPU spikes the error rates, the latency. You need to identify the root cause area and open cases to us to investigate whether this root cause area is an AWS or related to an AWS infrastructure service. We have no application context, so we play catch up and you need to catch us up. And then our incident management doesn't mirror your urgency because we are just now investigating services and all of these investigations are siloed. So we have a different way to support customers in these very critical components. We want to offer customized support that has the application context and has your urgency around investigation and recovery from these components. What we're proposing is that beyond just having this context, which we will need to work on proactively with you, you will also connect only certain specific signals of disruption from your environment into AWS so that you. You don't need to open a case to us to let us know we can pick up the same alarm that alerts your teams. That alongside backing you up with a team of specialists in investigation and escalation, allows us to commit to you that we will proactively reach out to you within five minutes of that alarm. You don't need to open cases. You don't need to wait. We'll pick up the alarm. We'll let you know that we're investigating. That will happen within under five minutes. We're on your bridge that you're spinning up. We will create a runbook that tells us how to join your bridge. And then from that point on the incident management will mirror what needs to happen in order to accelerate the recovery of this workload. Because of the context and because of runbooks that we can create. So very lengthy incident management could be even more complicated given some of the challenges that we have with a reactive scenario becomes a lot more truncated and efficient. It leverages proactive planning, runbooks and alarms coming from Lightbox to AWS support. It also leverages our ability to automate investigations within AWS so that your alarm triggers within AWS a simultaneous investigation into all of the infrastructure services within one minute. And after we engage with you within five minutes and you confirm this is an unplanned event, your teams are not testing something in the background that is spiking up this business application metric. We follow a predetermined course of investigation with aws. We don't stop when we rule out AWS altogether. Most of our customers issues are not AWS related, meaning it's not an AWS service that is having a service event. It's likely a configuration of that service in our customers architectures. So what happens when we rule out aws? We still help you recover with every subject matter expert that we have in AWS to bring in potential problem solvers in real time to work with your teams. So think of this as application support with application context, with AWS also acting as immediately as possible to investigate and provide resolvers. That resolution comes from identifying quickly where the issue is or isn't coming from and then providing the right experts to help you recover. I'm going to pause here for a moment. High level. Is this helping the new folks understand a little bit more what this additional support service is?\nD: John, do you have any more questions? I know we were discussing this yesterday.\nB: All right.\nA: No, I get it.\nE: Makes sense.\nC: Thanks, John. I'll describe two additional aspects to this service. So even if without even sorry, even if no incidents happen, what are you getting this service? Primarily we are focusing on your observability when we onboard you to the service. So we need to understand from you context of the application infrastructure, but also what signals of disruption are currently instrumented in the form of alarms, the business application layer as well as what alarms are on the infrastructure services. At this time we can add a lot more contact in additional metrics to infrastructure alarms as well as to instrumenting thresholds on the business application signals that would give your teams and our teams time to investigate and remediate before there's impact. So improving the observability on both layers, business application and infrastructure will allow your teams to drive faster correlation between where this disruption might be coming from that can be mirrored within AWS support. But for the purposes of this service we don't need you to push out all of your alarms. If we've helped you improve observability, the signals on the application would be enough because we have mapped them to infrastructure services in AWS and we'll create a runbook for us to investigate with those service teams. Secondly, every time the fault of alarm triggering to engagement with this team will happen, we will also share with you a report with data points of what happened in this particular investigation. Even without a big incident that helps you amass a data set of disruption and where it is or isn't coming from for a whole stack so that yourselves and your account team and help drive resiliency measures into those workloads to avoid recurrence of some of these issues. So all are included within the scope of this service. I mentioned some automation. This is a good example that takes the previous slide that we saw with sequential investigations and flips it into something very different. Your signal that will come into your team and to AWS on our side will automate this particular support case where all services underlying this workload or this critical metric will be started immediately. That's within one minute of that particular alarm. So when the incident management engineer from IDR joins your bridge they may already be able to tell you we've ruled out EC2 and ALB. Let's focus on RDS immediately. So cutting a lot of time for your teams to talk to the RDS team specialist. Two other scenarios and then I'll pause might be a scenario where someone on your side senses something is not optimal, something is starting to evolve that represents potential disruption. That team member will be able to open a case directly to this team. So even if no alarm was instrumented either yet or at all, as part of the initial alarm configuration, your team members will open a case from your console to IDR and receive a five minute response time. And following a runbook. So unlike that sequential investigation, we will now follow the path that we created for this particular component of your environment. A workload, stack, substack, etc. And third scenario in the scope of the service, if there is an AWS service event that is starting to manifest disruption, because we will have an understanding of how you're architected, from which zones in which regions we can correlate that disruption starting to evolve to a downstream impact on you. So even before a PhD notification is officially made telling you it's a service event, we will also proactively reach out to you so you are knowing what is happening continually from the earliest possible moment. You're in a position to make more informed decisions. And in this scenario we also don't disengage your panel join to help with implementation of any strategy to contain the scope of this impact, but you'll continually have information from this particular team. You have a single threaded owner from incident detection response from the alarm triggering until you're recovered. In each and every one of these scenarios not bound by ships, nobody is moving on to something else. So different engagement. Pausing here for a moment, David, John, Greg, is this a good refresher?\nB: I think so.\nC: Okay.\nH: Brandon, John or Rob, anyone from the lightbox side?\nC: Questions?\nA: Yeah.\nG: Okay.\nB: Workload includes everything that infrastructure and app support that, right?\nC: Yes, this is application support.\nA: Yeah, I don't have anything on my side yet.\nC: Okay Brandon, just let me know. So what does it mean to have idr? What would we need from you? What would it mean for your team and devoting some time to work with us? We integrate with your processes, we integrate also with some of your or so you maintain control ownership environment. We don't take over, replace or displace anything that you're doing. But we want to help you create efficiencies in the process. And we certainly want to mirror with AWS support the urgency that needs to happen when a signal like this triggers. So to understand the signal, we'll understand the infrastructure services that support this metric, its threshold and what other threshold will you've instrumented in the form of alarms on the application layer and the infrastructure layer. We'll then come to an agreement on the scope of which components in this workload, stack, sub stack, cluster, what have you like to have this kind of engagement with aws. And from that we will pare down the number of alarms to issue signals. And those signals we will ask that you will integrate with an Amazon tool called Amazon eventbridge. By the way, you're not required to duplicate anything that you're already doing. So if you have instrumented alarms through new Relic Dynatrace datadog, what have you, we'll just provide instructions how to integrate those alarms into EventBridge. EventBridge allows IDR to start getting the signals from you as well as instrument on our side, the corresponding runbook to this workload. So we are, for example, subscribing three components to this service. Three workloads, three steps. Each of them is going to have a specific corresponding runbook that will take some of this information and will allow us to create an efficient investigation within aws. It also means that to get this information, we will need a meeting with your teams. Those teams are very familiar with the architecture, with incidents with the alarms. And what we would ask is prior to this meeting, just share with us some information so that we're not wasting your time. We're coming on to talk about some of the components that you shared exist in your workload. Example, our infrastructure services, or what is currently alarmed when we do workload discovery, we want to do more than just have you share information. So if you've done something like a well architected framework on these components, this information exists, we'll use that. Or if you wouldn't mind just sharing a few details in advance, that would help. This meeting might be an hour, might be slightly longer. Depends on how many different components or clones we're onboarding the service. From that point on, everything can happen asynchronously. So emails will create a lot of artifacts. We'll share them back with you. We'll share some instructions around alarm definition if we need to, as well as instrumentation into the school through integration. And the last step might be testing. And this testing could be virtual or it could be in person, but that's entirely up to you. The work that we do proactively before you subscribe is pro bono. You're not paying yet for anything. You are starting to have a cost for this service. From the moment that you subscribe, components work close account, whatever you would like. That triggers billing. And from that point of billing, you'll also have immediately the ability to open cases to IDR. 5 minute response following runbooks that we'll create in this section on the left side. So billing starts here. We highly recommend to go through these next few stages so that we can pick up those alarms and reach out to you proactively. And we have helped customers go through this process in as little as two weeks. It could be longer, but it really depends on your urgency and your availability to go through it. If you told Peter and I and the rest of the team here, hey, we have no time for this right now. I have an option for automated onboarding as well. Pausing again.\nH: Okay, yeah, that might get interesting because we do have a lot of priorities and things on the plate, as I'm sure most of your customers do. Yeah, so that might be interesting to.\nA: Learn a little bit more about.\nH: But in the interest of not wasting too much time, let's skip to the pricing part of the conversation first because.\nC: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we have two options for pricing. I'll show you both options, but I'll recommend an option. So if it's okay if we can start with that and you can understand. Oh, sorry, let me. No, it is the right thing. Hold on, I'm going to reshare. Misplaced my slide, but I got it. No worries. Cheering AGAIN okay, so you have a few options to subscribe to incident detection and response. And what I did is I projected for you monthly costs based on current billable usage for support. That means your billable usage outside of what you're paying right now for enterprise support, outside of marketplace, outside of subscriptions, anything of that nature. Take this as an example. You'll give me a number or numbers of usage for your workloads. I'll rerun this. But ideally what we would look at is either the majority of your critical component and if there's no big cost difference, we can look at the entire usage. That means that you don't need to make a lot of decisions to start with, David, in order to make sure that we are matching your current bandwidth issues. So in this scenario, talking about this as the entire monthly usage, around 486,225. If we placed incident detection response across that entire usage and apply your discount, which is 10 and a half percent at the moment. Sorry, this says 11, but it's 10 and a half, we will be at around $6,000 per month. In addition to your enterprise support charge, that would be $5,926. If we said doesn't make sense to put it on the entire usage, let's carve out only four critical components. Anything up to $390,000 monthly usage will result in the minimum cost, the minimum cost on private pricing, which is a contract for the service will be $5,400. Then your discount reduces that to around 48.30. So at a minimum, David, we might be at 4830 per month. If we wanted to put it on everything, we might be around $6,000. I'll pause here just for a moment.\nB: Yeah, I can, I can't imagine that we would be more than 390,000. You know, consider just thinking in my mind where the money is.\nC: Okay.\nB: Non production environments and we have a lot of money, you know, tied up in storage and things like that. We'd probably be under 390,000.\nC: Perfect.\nB: At least at the moment. So we'd be looking at the minimal charge. Does that, is it safe to assume that that applies towards the buy down of the edp?\nC: Okay, great question. So yes, this would apply. By that I mean you're renewing your edp. If we are signing a service specific contract for this, it just gets added. So Peter takes all a look at all of your services. Any service specific private pricing agreements which you may have just get bundled up into your cross service agreement. From that point on, whatever discount rate you get on all services will apply to this. So right now you're at 10 and a half percent. Whatever that discount is will apply to this as well. What we want to do for you is two things. One is I would like to get you started on the service feature sooner rather than later. Coming up to holiday season your team is likely going to take some time off, hopefully for vacation. It would behoove you to have this additional support for the holiday season. So as soon as possible. Second reason is I have access to investment credits. I always have access to investment credits up to a certain point in time in the year. And if I don't use it, I lose it and so would my customers. I'd really want to give it to you. So if we are saying your cross Service Agreement is three years, this service will be for three years as well. I'll provide you three credits of the minimum $5,400. Even if you're paying 48.30, I'll still provide $5,400 in credit. That means you have time to onboard. We'll do the automated onboarding in the beginning but you'll start raising cases to IDR to have this support and you don't pay for it until three months have passed. By that I mean get a charge, get a credit, we can offset that charge. So net net you're at zero for the first three months.\nB: But we would have to lock into how, how long?\nC: Three years.\nB: Three.\nC: Yeah.\nB: Three year lock in for the service?\nC: Yes. Is that something that you would consider, Greg?\nB: I'll defer to Dave. To Dave and you know, and John on that. I, my only concern is I'm always reluctant to do these things in year one. We've been bitten by that, you know, so we get, you know, we, we, we lock in for three years and decide after year one that it's just not working out for us. I mean look, everything looks great, it looks great. You know, it seems like a great program but I would hate for us to figure out in year one that it just doesn't work for us in the way we operate and then we're locked in for two more years. So I'm always reluctant especially for something new, you know, to, to locking in when I wouldn't, you know what I wouldn't be opposed to is doing it. If David and John see value in it, doing it for one year and then at the end of one year then we do that. We could look at doing a three year lock in.\nC: I think that's perfect. I thought three years because of the cross service agreement. But you don't have to do three years, do it for one year. And Greg, other option altogether. Don't commit right now. Just use public pricing which is available to you. It means that the cost is higher. It means that I can't show ROI to my team to provide investment. But let us work something out. I, Peter and I can look into what we have to put in front of you even for that. So what would the cost look like on private. Sorry, this is private pricing. Public pricing. I'll pull that up in a moment. I'm just going to stop sharing for a sec. But Peter, from what we looked at last time it might be around $8,700 something of that nature. Greg, is that okay if we looked at that.\nB: Yeah, yeah that's fine.\nC: Yeah.\nA: And then Maya, I'm right that like the EDP discount obviously would still apply to the. Yeah, to that. Right. Or sorry, the cross service discount.\nC: Absolutely right. Only with private pricing. What I showed you, the minimum is $5400. We're actually giving you two lovers of discounts with private pricing. One is we're reducing the cost of service so we're talking about 48 something. And two, your discount applies with public pricing. I'm going to pull up a calculator and I'll send you a screenshot of it. And actually I'm going to do the 300 because that's a really good direction of where we want to go. My calculator should come up for you now.\nA: Yep.\nC: 69, 81 $7,000. The calculation on public pricing is the greater of 7,000 for 2%. This is your discount. It's actually 10 and a half percent.\nA: Yeah. But it just doesn't likely going up though as well. So you're not too far off on that.\nC: Yeah, it's 7K. And then if this is something that you want to do, not make a commitment right now for anything, just evaluate it, have it for the next three months, let's do that. And even with that option, Peter and I will find a way to help.\nA: Another.\nB: Yeah, again, the, the economics. I'm, I'm okay with the economics, you know, not, not having a long term commit. I just, you know, I think the decision is going to be up, really up to John and David and Brandon about whether or not it's something we can use. They foresee us using. I, I would definitely want to do some time, some type of short term if they decide, you know, it's, they want to try it, do some kind of, some type of short term, you know, POC of it maybe even on one of our more critical platforms just to make sure that it does, you know, it does work for us and it jives with our, you know, kind of our, the way we operate. Yeah, yeah.\nH: I'm not opposed to a trial. The concern that I have is the time that's needed to train and provide, you know, runbook material, even if it's not runbook material. But it's just sessions to teach.\nC: You.\nH: Know, the teams are fairly busy. But I'm not opposed to the, the POC idea.\nC: Would your.\nH: At the end of the day, I think at the end of the day, I think part of the challenge we mentioned this briefly last time as well is that there have been occasions where it's been slow to get support and I personally can't in good faith ask for more budget dollars for something that we're already not getting the best experience with.\nC: Understood.\nH: And that is just, you know, call it a personality trait if you want but you know that that's, I mean I won't be able to defend it. Right. So again, not opposed to the POC just to be able to demonstrate value. But honestly it's got to start with some of the basics. Right. Like tickets that have been opened where Rob can provide examples because I don't.\nD: Know them off the top of my.\nH: Head but you know, it's got to start, it's got to start with the basics, right? And that can't necessarily be tied to this because if we don't end up moving forward with idr, I don't want to all of a sudden go back to lesser support. I want to get the same support that we're already obligated and contracted for. I think the point is that there's a little bit of work to be done there anyways. And granted with the poc, I'm not sure how, given that prior comment, not really quite sure how you distinguish between two, because that might be fairly difficult. But I digress.\nC: No, it's okay. How would we distinguish between the two? We wouldn't want to, is the bottom line. What we need to understand is what is critical. And when something is critical, we need to be able to echo that across the organization instead of catching up to it one team at a time, one after another. So if we do a PoC, let's do it for the critical components, up to 390,000 on aggregate. It's going to be the same cost either way, which in the first three months, Peter and I are going to make sure that you don't, you don't bear it. If you want to open cases to this team, you do. So that means that we are not taxing your team time and taking an hour to do workload discovery. If we can do automated onboarding, we'll do that as well. It relies on CloudWatch alarms, so I don't know if that's something that even works, David, but we have certain ways of alleviating the pressure on your team to spend a lot of time. You're not going to have to share round books with us. It's just sharing some information about the workloads.\nA: Am I, am I right? Like when we're talking the poc, we're basically saying, look, let's, we don't, we won't ask for any like long term commitment right now. Let's just test it out. Like, let's add it at no long term commitment and then we'll, you know, we'll help out financially where we can and all that. But that's more or less the poc, right? Just no long term commitment.\nC: Yeah, it could be that. It could be on public pricing, which is that $7,000 with 390,000 on aggregate.\nA: And you would still get the EDP, the Cross Service private pricing agreement guys.\nC: Absolutely.\nB: Yeah.\nC: That cross service discount has been applied. So it applies to any service that you use, including this. Sound like David, Greg, you want to talk about this with Rob and the teams and figure out if this is something that you're interested in doing? Would it be okay if I just checked in with you next week just to see where we stand?\nB: Sure.\nH: I think that's fine. Yeah, it's. I mean, look, at the end of the day, you know, I think comments that were mentioned earlier, items.\nB: Lingerie.\nF: Right.\nH: The other. The other thing that I'll say, you know, is that. And I'm really trying to think of a way to phrase this without putting negative vibes out into the world or jinxing anything, but let's just say that if I think back over the last couple years, there's probably only one or two incidents where, you know, this may have really saved us.\nC: Okay, thanks for sharing that.\nB: Yeah, yeah, no problem.\nH: Again, try not to jinx anything. So, you know, everybody drop some salt over their shoulder and, you know, whatever, other.\nC: All right, folks, thank you so much again.\nF: Thank you, everybody. We'll be checking with you, and I will be sending the meeting notes. Have a great weekend, everybody.\nG: Appreciate it.\nB: Cedar, I think Peter and I are going to stay on. Okay. Do you want to stay on this call? You want to get on another call?\nA: No, this is great. As long as Alejandro will leave, I. I don't know who owns the meeting. So I think.\nB: Rob. Rob, you own this meeting. You want to make me the. The owner?\nH: Greg, do you need me or.\nB: You're welcome to stay on if you want. We're just talking. Talking some numbers around the edp.\nH: Gotcha. Okay.\nB: I'll hop off.\nH: If you need me. Just let me. Just let me know and I'll jump back on.\nB: Sure. I'll catch up with you after, Dave. Just let you know where. Kind of where we are right now.\nH: Yep, sounds good.\nA: Thanks.\nB: Hey, Rob, you still there? Well, we may stand up if Rob comes back and. On mute.\nD: Oh, you're Peter, the host. Because F. You, Greg.\nC: A. You don't trust me, do you?\nB: You don't trust me.\nA: Wow.\nB: Tough crowd, right?\nA: Yeah, really? Really.\nB: I got the sun in my face here. I'm just going to.\nA: Yeah, you're good. You're good.\nB: Lines A little bit. It's better.\nA: All right.\nD: All right.\nC: So.\nA: Yeah.\nB: So I go. Well, why don't you go first? Tell me what you got. Tell me what you came up with.\nA: Yeah, I had to dig into some stuff. It took me a minute to. To figure out where all the numbers are coming from, basically because it's a little bit different. So a couple things. First, I confirmed that any, like, surplus, like, anything you spend beyond your commitment doesn't roll like that. So. And the reasoning behind that is like, hey, we want them to commit where they're going to spend. Of course, shortfall obviously rolls, so I get it.\nG: So if I miss.\nB: If I go beyond my commitment year one, but under my commitment year two, I'll still owe the difference in year two, but that'll get applied as a credit to year three.\nA: Yeah, yeah. I mean, look, there's no way to cut it where you're not. I do think they try to do a good job of being fair in these agreements, but I would say this is the one thing where it's like, there's no way to cut it, where it's not kind of aws pressing their leverage a little bit, I guess. Like, it's like, okay, well, if there's a shortfall, you're going to owe us and we're going to roll it now. We won't take your money away. It's like, well, duh, they shouldn't. But yeah, if you spend more, it's like, well, no, you know, we wanted you to forecast that accurately. And now, you know, you're not punished in any way. You still get the discount on anything you spend over that and all that. But obviously, yeah, it's. It's a little bit. Yeah, that's ultimately.\nB: Ultimately, though, theoretically, if we hit, say we commit to $33 million, ultimately, at the end of the day, if we hit that $33 million or more at the end, it'll come out as a.\nA: Wash. That's exactly right. You.\nB: Unless, you know, it's interesting because I'm trying to think of a scenario because, say I went over in years one through four.\nA: Oh, yeah.\nB: But I was under in year five, and yet I still hit my commitment.\nA: Yeah, that's true. And technically, look, there's the answer where it's like, if everything became. In five years, for fun, let's pretend you and I are just gone in five years. Right? And in five years, this deal comes up and that the scenario you just mentioned happens legally, they're going to say, no, no, no. Yeah, we hear what you're saying, but you owe us the money, and that's a shortfall. What's really going to happen is if you overspent in those years and in year five, you're getting close to hitting your commit, they're going to just wait for you to hit your commit and they're going to renegotiate the deal with you. Is what's going to happen. But now that's, but like there's no way to build that into the contract. So it's not very comforting to tell customers that. But so you're right about that is the scenario.\nB: Yeah.\nA: Now like to me, I, to me it's another reason to build conservative growth into your, you know, into your plan. Right. And it, it's about. Okay, so let me tell you where. So that's that. Now let me tell you where, how I got to some answers on this and kind of what the why I think there's some like a little challenge with the year one numbers and I'll tell you why. So, so here's what's happening. They and we. I'm glad you caught it on the payer account because they would have caught this since we added the payer account previously, they would definitely have seen this in the approvals process and said wait, wait, wait, you're not including this, this money. So, so from light, from the Lightbox perspective, if you look at say Cost Explorer and I'm reading off my notes here, it's like you're going to see that you're trailing twelve month spend. The primary payer account that you've been using, the EDR account is like around that 6.22 number I think that you shared with me.\nB: Right.\nA: Which matches up pretty well with me. And then in the other payer account you're going to see about 58,000, 57, 58,000 and a lot of that's back weighted. Well the challenge is that and this is like not something they shift on or this has always been the policy from aws they say, well when we measure annual commits for the purpose of a new agreement, we look at the trailing six months and we just double that because we want an accurate representation of what the customer has been spending recently. Say they grew 40% in the last year. Like we want to know you know anyhow where that, where that made the numbers a little interesting. The core numbers around the service spend is that in your baseline if you're looking at your trailing 12 months, you're adding in that 58k when I'm adding in a basel that I have to operate by, I'm adding in 115k because they've doubled that. They said well going forward that's not going to be that. You know, there won't be zero spend months like there were at the beginning of the year. And so that's why we were, I was a little off and I was trying to figure out why that was happening. That's one reason. Well, really, those are two reasons. It's like, look, we don't. We don't look at the trailing twelve. We look at the last six. Yeah. Now there's a world. I ran some of the numbers a little bit on like, okay, does it. Is there a world where it makes sense to wait a couple months? Because I was looking at like, all right, well, you have a pretty high spend month in there. You know, we do. We account for Marketplace. Right. And so it's like, well, July was high spend. I think that might drop out. But then you look at this month, you guys are tracking high. And so I just couldn't get to a place where it made sense to push it. Basically, the commit's going to keep going up.\nB: Yeah.\nG: And that's.\nB: And that's a concern I have. So let's just cut to the chase and tell me where you have watch the numbers you have for. Because I rejiggered the numbers a little bit and I can come up, you know, I'm looking at where we plan to be in the budget 20, 25, and I think we can come up.\nA: Slightly on that number.\nB: I just want to see how much AWS is expecting us to come up with.\nA: Yeah, well, let me. So let me tell you how I got to it, because I'm kind of. Here's the thing. So AWS is asking me for like 10%. Right. And my thing is like, I'm just trying to come up with something. I'm like doing my own analysis. Like, how can I get it above 0% and like not. And not get triggered.\nB: Yeah.\nA: And what was. So here's what I was trying to do. I was trying to say we want to go up from the baseline I have. Which was 6,000, 808. When. 6.8 million. When I. When we were talking, I want to go up 3%. And that was kind of pushing me up around that 7,000 number. Let me put. I'm gonna pull these up. Exactly. My spreadsheet's a mess, but I'm going to just tell you where do I have this Equ. Yeah. So that brought me up just over 7 million. But two things happened when I started to dig in to the numbers. So the first thing is adding in that 115k, which doesn't make it a massive problem, but that brings it up. And then the second thing is that I need to make sure this is going to go for approvals next month. And so what I need to do is leave enough cushion in there that the dollars that drop out from the six month trailing spend aren't eclipsed too much by the December numbers because they will have an eye on those and I don't want them in the last second in the process to say wait a second, this is negative growth. So now staying around 3% because the minute I go under 1% it starts to throw up flags in the system. And so the best number I could get at, and this is just me estimating based on what it says you guys are going to finish at plus the spend in that other accounts going up a bit was basically I said okay, I think we're that that trailing six month annualized number plus all of that is going to fall as 6.993. And so at that number 3% comes up to 7 2. I feel there's room below that. But my thought, the reason I asked to jump on the call is like okay, if we're looking at the difference between like 71 and 72 to get to that number, but we're risking. I was like what is Lightbox comfortable forecasting in the next year? Because I think we do need to start from. It doesn't matter if we're doing this, we can't give you a number that you guys aren't going to hit. That's my rule number one. And it ruins relationships having the shortfall even though I feel like we could get there and figure it out. So that's a lot, that's a lot of shit I just said. So like what are you guys comfortable at? And then we'll decide on the number together. And by the way, sorry, I gotta tell you two other things. Okay, the other thing is let's again, you need to be able to hit that year one number. After that I think let's pull out some, you know, some commit from later in the contract if we need to to get the overall number where you need to be. That's totally okay. What I 1 thought I had is look, we're coming to you guys and saying we want to do this AML thing and like we're pitching savings that are pretty, pretty high and that's a priority from the leadership. And so if what we want to say is year two is going to stay pretty flat but I built enough like cushion in there to say look, this isn't a flat, this isn't a flat number. Look at their trailing twelve months. True. Trailing twelve months. Like practically speaking we're talking about growth here and we want to build A cushion in year two because we're saying we're going to save them all this money and then look, they're going to grow in years three, four and five. We can do that. Right? So like that was one place where I thought we stay flat in year two or something like that. Sorry, I'll leave it to you now on the. What you guys are comfortable with in the next 12 months.\nB: So it's funny, you know, before we got in the meeting earlier today, after you sent your message, I rejigged the numbers. I'll show you where I came in.\nA: Okay.\nB: So I came in at 7.157.15 million. Let me increase the size here.\nA: No, this is better. This is first of all we're very close on it. So it happens when to put two geniuses on a call. But your level of organization on a spreadsheet is. So my wife would just like have a seizure looking at mine and love looking at yours. Okay.\nB: So yeah, so I came in and I did, I did want to show growth, but conservative growth and still get us around to that 37 million five year commitment. So this has a starting at 71 50, which is, which is the number. I, I'm not too comfortable going above that.\nA: Okay.\nB: I, I think we are going to end up above that, but I just want to especially knowing that I don't want to, I don't want to end up in any year. Oh wait. I think over the span of the 5 years, I think we're going to be fairly easy to hit the 37 million. I just don't want to end up short in any year that's going to leave. It's going to. Cause I think it's going to end up costing, causing a lot of grief on our side about accounting for it and everything. So I want, that's why I wanted to be a little conservative. I do see us growing. So I see us, you know, I saying using 7.15, you know, as the starting point, then growing 2% and then being a little bit more conservative in years four or five because it's hard to look out. I don't want to say we're going to be flat. I think we are going to grow, but it's hard to say where things are going to be in years four or five. And that's, that's part, you know, kind of part of the risk of getting that extra couple percentage points but going with five year. So what I'm trying to be is fair and say yes, we plan. Look, you Know, we're committing to five years being with aws five years. We're also planning on growing. We're not going to be growing astronomically. So I think these numbers are fair.\nA: So do I think and I did.\nB: I did adjust, I adjusted the 2024 number. I think we're going to end looking at both accounts and even a couple of other small accounts that we've got that are like under, you know, like, I think like a couple. There were a couple of orphans that were under a couple hundred dollars all told. If my predictions. Sorry, if my projections come out right, we're going to be just under seven in. We're going to finish 2024 just under seven. And that. So 7.15 is about a 3.3% growth.\nA: That's exactly what I had at 715-715. I particularly if you feel this is like the right commit for next year, I think this is a great place to stay. And I think like this is, these are the numbers I take to the team. I'm just looking through. I had 3.3% growth. I think what I'm trying to like ballpark in my head, I have you guys coming in around that number too. You say six nine, two one. And I think I, yeah, that's funny. I think I pegged it at 6. Do I have that? This is why organization's a problem. Yeah. 6993, basically. So we're pretty close. And this is just guessing. If we end there, then the 7150 number stays positive next month. And that's like the, that is really the benchmark for me. So I think this, I think this gets us there. And not to mention, I don't think a 7:2 number builds in that much cushion. So it's like, you know, we're either there or not.\nC: Exactly.\nA: Okay, this is great. If I feel very comfortable, it's helpful that you came up that bit because that cushion was at 7 was feeling really tight to me and I was worried that was going to cause us some problems.\nF: Yeah.\nA: So this look, I think this looks great. And the case, I know I said this to you, but the case I'm going to make to them too is look like we're pitching this 24 month modernization thing. And like that's by the way, we're pitching that for a reason. Right. That benefits us. You know, the more you move away from Windows say, the more you're, you know, able to modernize with us and integrate other services more deeply and blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.\nF: Yeah.\nA: Okay. This is great. So let me. Do you care. Do you mind if I take a screenshot of this just so I don't have to?\nB: No, not at all.\nA: Not at all.\nB: Go ahead. Yeah. And I also want to Pat. You know, the other thing I wanted to kind of pad in here is potential. I know that there's still opportunity for some savings, you know, for us to reduce cost. You know, I. I think just, you know, I just went through and did a whole big cleanup of our S3, which Dr. You know, that brought us down $30,000 a month.\nA: Yep. Right, right, right.\nB: I think there's other opportunities to do that. So that's why I'm trying to hedge a little bit. Honestly, Peter, I think we're going to find ourselves probably in year four renegotiating, you know, then I. I think we're going to hit target, probably like, you know, mid to late year four. And look, we can, you know, we can figure it out then, but I just don't want to. I need to hedge here, and I need to make sure that, you know, we aren't going to end up upside down.\nA: I hear you, man. I think it's. For what it's worth. I mean, I've done a fair amount of these at this point, more than most account managers. And I think, like, you've taken the right approach. I also think I have enough of the, you know, look, I'm going to take these. I'm going to go try to get approval now, and we'll find out if we run into any barriers right away. But my gut having done these is, you know, I feel good. It's gotten harder to do these, if I'm being really honest with you. They, like, they built a bit more structure, and that's, like, harder to work around. The marketplace thing, for instance, is, like, you can imagine how that becomes a challenging thing. So I feel good about this. I'm going to go start getting approvals like this is. This looks like a great number to me. And the breakdown, showing some growth and having a story around why we need to, you know, why this growth is. Right. I think is really helpful, and you've given me enough to do that. So we're in. We're in good shape. I'm going to. The way I do this normally is if I know you said I could do this yesterday, and then I backed. I reneged on my offer. I'm going to take these numbers and I'm going to go. And first I'll socialize it with the two, it's a fairly flat organization. Like, it'll ultimately go up pretty high, but, like, I socialize it with my up to my director level and they'll let me know very quickly. And I suspect they're the ones who are going to say, yeah, all right, we're all right. And then I start submitting the official approvals to get a term sheet. And it just takes a little bit of time, but it shouldn't be, you know, looking at this because we're not doing anything crazy or I'm not making a request that I'm saying, like, hey, Greg, I can't get this approved and you're telling me to submit it anyways. I think they should turn it around fairly quickly. Now, one thing is, each SLA is kind of like two days, and we're heading into Thanksgiving and all that. But I'll give you as much time as possible, and I'm going to try to submit it. Like, I'm at least going to try to socialize it today.\nB: Yeah. And I, I still got to get approvals, more approvals. I don't think I'm going to have a problem getting approvals on our end, but our legal team is going to want to review the contract and do all their, you know.\nA: Yeah.\nB: Their usual stuff. And, and they're going to have quite. There's going to be questions. Yeah, I know the CTO has already gone, you know, is already given the CFO and the CEO a heads up on the deal. And, you know, that we're working, we're working with you to, you know, to renew our edp. And so they're aware of it and they're not, you know, they're not opposed to it.\nA: Perfect.\nB: I don't think we're going to get any resistance, but it's just got to go through the channels.\nA: We're both in the same place. Like, it sounds like my position is very similar. Like, I, I feel good about it, goes over my head eventually. So, you know, we still got to go through those. I did want to tell you, you mentioned that, you know, the legal team, one thing that's worth knowing, kind of just having in your back pocket, the way the agreements work, even the previous agreement, you know, like the MSA that customers sign is like, way back when they open an account. Right. Which is crazy if you think about it. And so every agreement after that, outside of like some random crazy enterprise agreement that has other partnership stuff in it, is typically an addendum to the msa. And so the so Even the EDP that you guys have right now is just an addendum to the MSA and the terms in this agreement, like, it's not that it won't look a little different and totally have to be reviewed by legal, but what I've run into in the past is like the, you know, GC coming back to me and saying, hey, we, like, we don't want, we want to redline this term. And I have to say, hey, like, sorry, you literally actually already agreed to that term back in msa. Like, this isn't even, you're already, you're already on the hook for this not my fault, you know, type of thing or, you know, there aren't going to be any terms in this agreement that you have that you didn't see in your last. EDP is generally. So it's helpful to have in your back pocket.\nB: Yeah, no, that's great, that's, that's great to know, Peter, because I can, I, and I ask that question often with, you know, when I'm dealing with vendors, I'm like, has anything changed? They're going to want to review it again, you know, but, but I can at least go in telling them, you know, telling our chief legal officer, Paul, you know, nothing, nothing should have changed here. If you catch anything, let me know. But nothing should have changed between this and our last one.\nA: Totally. And they 100% should do for the, do the full review. I just do think it's helpful for you as you go through, through it to know that like it's a two page agreement.\nB: Right.\nA: And a lot of times they, if, you know, in house counsel, haven't looked at this before or been part of the EDP process, they're expecting a longer contract. That's net new and like, you know, and they understand, obviously they understand the concept of MSAs, but I'm just saying they're like looking at this like it's going to be a big enterprise agreement and it's like, no, this is just an addendum to the ones we've already done saying, hey, you know, here's what's happening for the next five years on spend and that's about it. So cool. This is great. So you feel good, these numbers? Exactly. That I took a screenshot of.\nB: Yeah, I feel good about those.\nA: Cool. I'm gonna go start working on it. And yeah, I think we're like, I think we're in a good place. You know, it's like, especially with the modernization stuff. So let me see what they say.\nB: Awesome.\nA: Cool. I will. I'll talk to you soon. Yeah, if I hear something today, I'll let you know, but I. Nothing's getting done today anyways, so I don't want to bother you heading into the weekend.\nB: Nah, it's no worries. I mean, yeah, if you need me, definitely reach out, but I wouldn't expect anything probably till, like, early next week.\nA: Perfect. Yeah, I'll come back to you with some updates then.\nB: Sounds good.\nA: All right, Greg, thanks for taking the time. This is really helpful.\nB: No, no problem. Thank you, Peter.\nA: Yeah, of course. Talk to you soon.\nB: Talk to you. It.",

First update - I went ahead and shared the meeting materials and tools we discussed, including the business case tool and workload profile worksheet. Sent that to the whole team last Friday, so that item is done.\n\nA: Great, thank you B. Jackie, any updates on your end?\n\nJackie: Yes, I completed the AML scoping clarifications. I sent over the Q4 special offer details and the technical discovery engagement information to the team. All wrapped up on my side.\n\nA: Perfect. Alejandro, what about the RDS database backup list?\n\nAlejandro: Still working on that one. I've identified most of the Aurora MySQL databases without backups, but I'm waiting on access to one more account to complete the full list.
