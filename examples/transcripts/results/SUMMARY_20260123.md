## Per-Transcript Breakdown

### Sequence 1: Call 1
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Text Length | 51,804 chars |
| Processing Time | 24.5s |
| Items Extracted | 2 (all new) |
| Matched Existing | 2 |
| Created | 0 |
| Updated | 2 |

**Note:** This transcript's 2 action items matched items from a previous test run (before the script crashed), so they were updated rather than created.

**Stage Timings:**
- Extraction: 10.34s
- Matching: 6.96s
- Merging: 6.34s

## Matching Analysis

### Why Calls 2 and 3 Had No Matches

The matching algorithm compares newly extracted action items against existing items in the graph using:
1. **Vector similarity** (embedding cosine distance)
2. **LLM-based deduplication** (semantic comparison)

**Observations:**
- Call 1's items were matched because identical items existed from a previous run
- Calls 2 and 3 extracted action items about different topics (RDS backups, credit memos, MAP calls, etc.) that had no semantic overlap with the 2 items from Call 1

**This is expected behavior** - the pipeline correctly identified that the action items across these calls are genuinely different, not duplicates.

## Performance Analysis

| Stage | Call 1 | Call 2 | Call 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Extraction | 10.34s | 26.85s | 38.45s |
| Matching | 6.96s | 6.71s | 69.98s |
| Merging | 6.34s | 6.22s | 11.63s |
| **Total** | **24.5s** | **40.1s** | **120.5s** |

**Notes:**
- Extraction time scales with transcript length
- Matching time for Call 3 was longer because it had 15 items to compare against the growing pool of existing items (now 28 total)
- Merging time scales with number of items

## Next Steps

To test matching more effectively:
1. Create a follow-up transcript that explicitly references items from these calls (e.g., "I completed the RDS backup list that Alejandro mentioned")
2. Process it as Sequence 4 to see if the pipeline correctly matches and updates existing items
